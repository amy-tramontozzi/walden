*** start of the project gutenberg ebook 205 ***waldenandon the duty of civil disobedienceby henry david thoreaucovercontents walden economy where i lived and what i lived for reading sounds solitude visitors the bean-field the village the ponds baker farm higher laws brute neighbors house-warming former inhabitants and winter visitors winter animals the pond in winter spring conclusion on the duty of civil disobediencewaldeneconomywhen i wrote the following pages or rather the bulk of them i livedalone in the woods a mile from any neighbor in a house which i hadbuilt myself on the shore of walden pond in concord massachusettsand earned my living by the labor of my hands only
i lived there twoyears and two months
at present i am a sojourner in civilized lifeagain
i should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers ifvery particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerningmy mode of life which some would call impertinent though they do notappear to me at all impertinent but considering the circumstancesvery natural and pertinent
some have asked what i got to eat if i didnot feel lonesome if i was not afraid and the like
others have beencurious to learn what portion of my income i devoted to charitablepurposes and some who have large families how many poor children imaintained
i will therefore ask those of my readers who feel noparticular interest in me to pardon me if i undertake to answer some ofthese questions in this book
in most books the _i_ or first personis omitted in this it will be retained that in respect to egotismis the main difference
we commonly do not remember that it is afterall always the first person that is speaking
i should not talk somuch about myself if there were anybody else whom i knew as well
unfortunately i am confined to this theme by the narrowness of myexperience
moreover i on my side require of every writer first orlast a simple and sincere account of his own life and not merely whathe has heard of other men’s lives some such account as he would sendto his kindred from a distant land for if he has lived sincerely itmust have been in a distant land to me
perhaps these pages are moreparticularly addressed to poor students
as for the rest of my readersthey will accept such portions as apply to them
i trust that none willstretch the seams in putting on the coat for it may do good service tohim whom it fits
i would fain say something not so much concerning the chinese andsandwich islanders as you who read these pages who are said to live innew england something about your condition especially your outwardcondition or circumstances in this world in this town what it iswhether it is necessary that it be as bad as it is whether it cannotbe improved as well as not
i have travelled a good deal in concordand everywhere in shops and offices and fields the inhabitants haveappeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways
whati have heard of brahmins sitting exposed to four fires and looking inthe face of the sun or hanging suspended with their heads downwardover flames or looking at the heavens over their shoulders “until itbecomes impossible for them to resume their natural position whilefrom the twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into thestomach” or dwelling chained for life at the foot of a tree ormeasuring with their bodies like caterpillars the breadth of vastempires or standing on one leg on the tops of pillars—even theseforms of conscious penance are hardly more incredible and astonishingthan the scenes which i daily witness
the twelve labors of herculeswere trifling in comparison with those which my neighbors haveundertaken for they were only twelve and had an end but i couldnever see that these men slew or captured any monster or finished anylabor
they have no friend iolas to burn with a hot iron the root ofthe hydra’s head but as soon as one head is crushed two spring up
i see young men my townsmen whose misfortune it is to have inheritedfarms houses barns cattle and farming tools for these are moreeasily acquired than got rid of
better if they had been born in theopen pasture and suckled by a wolf that they might have seen withclearer eyes what field they were called to labor in
who made themserfs of the soil
why should they eat their sixty acres when man iscondemned to eat only his peck of dirt
why should they begin diggingtheir graves as soon as they are born
they have got to live a man’slife pushing all these things before them and get on as well as theycan
how many a poor immortal soul have i met well nigh crushed andsmothered under its load creeping down the road of life pushingbefore it a barn seventy-five feet by forty its augean stables nevercleansed and one hundred acres of land tillage mowing pasture andwood-lot
the portionless who struggle with no such unnecessaryinherited encumbrances find it labor enough to subdue and cultivate afew cubic feet of flesh
but men labor under a mistake
the better part of the man is soonplowed into the soil for compost
by a seeming fate commonly callednecessity they are employed as it says in an old book laying uptreasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break throughand steal
it is a fool’s life as they will find when they get to theend of it if not before
it is said that deucalion and pyrrha createdmen by throwing stones over their heads behind them—     inde genus durum sumus experiensque laborum     et documenta damus quâ simus origine nati
or as raleigh rhymes it in his sonorous way—     “from thence our kind hard-hearted is enduring pain and care     approving that our bodies of a stony nature are
”so much for a blind obedience to a blundering oracle throwing thestones over their heads behind them and not seeing where they fell
most men even in this comparatively free country through mereignorance and mistake are so occupied with the factitious cares andsuperfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot beplucked by them
their fingers from excessive toil are too clumsy andtremble too much for that
actually the laboring man has not leisurefor a true integrity day by day he cannot afford to sustain themanliest relations to men his labor would be depreciated in themarket
he has no time to be anything but a machine
how can heremember well his ignorance—which his growth requires—who has so oftento use his knowledge
we should feed and clothe him gratuitouslysometimes and recruit him with our cordials before we judge of him
the finest qualities of our nature like the bloom on fruits can bepreserved only by the most delicate handling
yet we do not treatourselves nor one another thus tenderly
some of you we all know are poor find it hard to live aresometimes as it were gasping for breath
i have no doubt that some ofyou who read this book are unable to pay for all the dinners which youhave actually eaten or for the coats and shoes which are fast wearingor are already worn out and have come to this page to spend borrowedor stolen time robbing your creditors of an hour
it is very evidentwhat mean and sneaking lives many of you live for my sight has beenwhetted by experience always on the limits trying to get intobusiness and trying to get out of debt a very ancient slough calledby the latins _æs alienum_ another’s brass for some of their coinswere made of brass still living and dying and buried by this other’sbrass always promising to pay promising to pay tomorrow and dyingtoday insolvent seeking to curry favor to get custom by how manymodes only not state-prison offences lying flattering votingcontracting yourselves into a nutshell of civility or dilating into anatmosphere of thin and vaporous generosity that you may persuade yourneighbor to let you make his shoes or his hat or his coat or hiscarriage or import his groceries for him making yourselves sick thatyou may lay up something against a sick day something to be tuckedaway in an old chest or in a stocking behind the plastering or moresafely in the brick bank no matter where no matter how much or howlittle
i sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous i may almost say as toattend to the gross but somewhat foreign form of servitude called negroslavery there are so many keen and subtle masters that enslave bothnorth and south
it is hard to have a southern overseer it is worse tohave a northern one but worst of all when you are the slave-driver ofyourself
talk of a divinity in man
look at the teamster on thehighway wending to market by day or night does any divinity stirwithin him
his highest duty to fodder and water his horses
what ishis destiny to him compared with the shipping interests
does not hedrive for squire make-a-stir
how godlike how immortal is he
see howhe cowers and sneaks how vaguely all the day he fears not beingimmortal nor divine but the slave and prisoner of his own opinion ofhimself a fame won by his own deeds
public opinion is a weak tyrantcompared with our own private opinion
what a man thinks of himselfthat it is which determines or rather indicates his fate
self-emancipation even in the west indian provinces of the fancy andimagination—what wilberforce is there to bring that about
thinkalso of the ladies of the land weaving toilet cushions against thelast day not to betray too green an interest in their fates
as if youcould kill time without injuring eternity
the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation
what is calledresignation is confirmed desperation
from the desperate city you gointo the desperate country and have to console yourself with thebravery of minks and muskrats
a stereotyped but unconscious despair isconcealed even under what are called the games and amusements ofmankind
there is no play in them for this comes after work
but it isa characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things
when we consider what to use the words of the catechism is the chiefend of man and what are the true necessaries and means of life itappears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of livingbecause they preferred it to any other
yet they honestly think thereis no choice left
but alert and healthy natures remember that the sunrose clear
it is never too late to give up our prejudices
no way ofthinking or doing however ancient can be trusted without proof
whateverybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day may turn out tobe falsehood to-morrow mere smoke of opinion which some had trustedfor a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields
whatold people say you cannot do you try and find that you can
old deedsfor old people and new deeds for new
old people did not know enoughonce perchance to fetch fresh fuel to keep the fire a-going newpeople put a little dry wood under a pot and are whirled round theglobe with the speed of birds in a way to kill old people as thephrase is
age is no better hardly so well qualified for aninstructor as youth for it has not profited so much as it has lost
one may almost doubt if the wisest man has learned any thing ofabsolute value by living
practically the old have no very importantadvice to give the young their own experience has been so partial andtheir lives have been such miserable failures for private reasons asthey must believe and it may be that they have some faith left whichbelies that experience and they are only less young than they were
ihave lived some thirty years on this planet and i have yet to hear thefirst syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors
theyhave told me nothing and probably cannot tell me any thing to thepurpose
here is life an experiment to a great extent untried by mebut it does not avail me that they have tried it
if i have anyexperience which i think valuable i am sure to reflect that this mymentors said nothing about
one farmer says to me “you cannot live on vegetable food solely forit furnishes nothing to make bones with” and so he religiously devotesa part of his day to supplying his system with the raw material ofbones walking all the while he talks behind his oxen which withvegetable-made bones jerk him and his lumbering plough along in spiteof every obstacle
some things are really necessaries of life in somecircles the most helpless and diseased which in others are luxuriesmerely and in others still are entirely unknown
the whole ground of human life seems to some to have been gone over bytheir predecessors both the heights and the valleys and all things tohave been cared for
according to evelyn “the wise solomon prescribedordinances for the very distances of trees and the roman prætors havedecided how often you may go into your neighbor’s land to gather theacorns which fall on it without trespass and what share belongs tothat neighbor
” hippocrates has even left directions how we should cutour nails that is even with the ends of the fingers neither shorternor longer
undoubtedly the very tedium and ennui which presume to haveexhausted the variety and the joys of life are as old as adam
butman’s capacities have never been measured nor are we to judge of whathe can do by any precedents so little has been tried
whatever havebeen thy failures hitherto “be not afflicted my child for who shallassign to thee what thou hast left undone
”we might try our lives by a thousand simple tests as for instancethat the same sun which ripens my beans illumines at once a system ofearths like ours
if i had remembered this it would have prevented somemistakes
this was not the light in which i hoed them
the stars arethe apexes of what wonderful triangles
what distant and differentbeings in the various mansions of the universe are contemplating thesame one at the same moment
nature and human life are as various asour several constitutions
who shall say what prospect life offers toanother
could a greater miracle take place than for us to look througheach other’s eyes for an instant
we should live in all the ages of theworld in an hour ay in all the worlds of the ages
history poetrymythology
—i know of no reading of another’s experience so startlingand informing as this would be
the greater part of what my neighbors call good i believe in my soul tobe bad and if i repent of anything it is very likely to be my goodbehavior
what demon possessed me that i behaved so well
you may saythe wisest thing you can old man—you who have lived seventy yearsnot without honor of a kind—i hear an irresistible voice which invitesme away from all that
one generation abandons the enterprises ofanother like stranded vessels
i think that we may safely trust a good deal more than we do
we maywaive just so much care of ourselves as we honestly bestow elsewhere
nature is as well adapted to our weakness as to our strength
theincessant anxiety and strain of some is a well nigh incurable form ofdisease
we are made to exaggerate the importance of what work we doand yet how much is not done by us
or what if we had been taken sick
how vigilant we are
determined not to live by faith if we can avoidit all the day long on the alert at night we unwillingly say ourprayers and commit ourselves to uncertainties
so thoroughly andsincerely are we compelled to live reverencing our life and denyingthe possibility of change
this is the only way we say but there areas many ways as there can be drawn radii from one centre
all change isa miracle to contemplate but it is a miracle which is taking placeevery instant
confucius said “to know that we know what we know andthat we do not know what we do not know that is true knowledge
” whenone man has reduced a fact of the imagination to be a fact to hisunderstanding i foresee that all men at length establish their liveson that basis
let us consider for a moment what most of the trouble and anxiety whichi have referred to is about and how much it is necessary that we betroubled or at least careful
it would be some advantage to live aprimitive and frontier life though in the midst of an outwardcivilization if only to learn what are the gross necessaries of lifeand what methods have been taken to obtain them or even to look overthe old day-books of the merchants to see what it was that men mostcommonly bought at the stores what they stored that is what are thegrossest groceries
for the improvements of ages have had but littleinfluence on the essential laws of man’s existence as our skeletonsprobably are not to be distinguished from those of our ancestors
by the words _necessary of life_ i mean whatever of all that manobtains by his own exertions has been from the first or from long usehas become so important to human life that few if any whether fromsavageness or poverty or philosophy ever attempt to do without it
to many creatures there is in this sense but one necessary of lifefood
to the bison of the prairie it is a few inches of palatablegrass with water to drink unless he seeks the shelter of the forestor the mountain’s shadow
none of the brute creation requires more thanfood and shelter
the necessaries of life for man in this climate mayaccurately enough be distributed under the several heads of foodshelter clothing and fuel for not till we have secured these are weprepared to entertain the true problems of life with freedom and aprospect of success
man has invented not only houses but clothes andcooked food and possibly from the accidental discovery of the warmthof fire and the consequent use of it at first a luxury arose thepresent necessity to sit by it
we observe cats and dogs acquiring thesame second nature
by proper shelter and clothing we legitimatelyretain our own internal heat but with an excess of these or of fuelthat is with an external heat greater than our own internal may notcookery properly be said to begin
darwin the naturalist says of theinhabitants of tierra del fuego that while his own party who werewell clothed and sitting close to a fire were far from too warm thesenaked savages who were farther off were observed to his greatsurprise “to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such aroasting
” so we are told the new hollander goes naked with impunitywhile the european shivers in his clothes
is it impossible to combinethe hardiness of these savages with the intellectualness of thecivilized man
according to liebig man’s body is a stove and food thefuel which keeps up the internal combustion in the lungs
in coldweather we eat more in warm less
the animal heat is the result of aslow combustion and disease and death take place when this is toorapid or for want of fuel or from some defect in the draught thefire goes out
of course the vital heat is not to be confounded withfire but so much for analogy
it appears therefore from the abovelist that the expression _animal life_ is nearly synonymous with theexpression _animal heat_ for while food may be regarded as the fuelwhich keeps up the fire within us—and fuel serves only to prepare thatfood or to increase the warmth of our bodies by addition fromwithout—shelter and clothing also serve only to retain the _heat_ thusgenerated and absorbed
the grand necessity then for our bodies is to keep warm to keep thevital heat in us
what pains we accordingly take not only with ourfood and clothing and shelter but with our beds which are ournight-clothes robbing the nests and breasts of birds to prepare thisshelter within a shelter as the mole has its bed of grass and leavesat the end of its burrow
the poor man is wont to complain that this isa cold world and to cold no less physical than social we referdirectly a great part of our ails
the summer in some climates makespossible to man a sort of elysian life
fuel except to cook his foodis then unnecessary the sun is his fire and many of the fruits aresufficiently cooked by its rays while food generally is more variousand more easily obtained and clothing and shelter are wholly or halfunnecessary
at the present day and in this country as i find by myown experience a few implements a knife an axe a spade awheelbarrow &c
and for the studious lamplight stationery andaccess to a few books rank next to necessaries and can all beobtained at a trifling cost
yet some not wise go to the other sideof the globe to barbarous and unhealthy regions and devote themselvesto trade for ten or twenty years in order that they may live—that iskeep comfortably warm—and die in new england at last
the luxuriouslyrich are not simply kept comfortably warm but unnaturally hot as iimplied before they are cooked of course _à la mode_
most of the luxuries and many of the so called comforts of life arenot only not indispensable but positive hindrances to the elevation ofmankind
with respect to luxuries and comforts the wisest have everlived a more simple and meagre life than the poor
the ancientphilosophers chinese hindoo persian and greek were a class thanwhich none has been poorer in outward riches none so rich in inward
we know not much about them
it is remarkable that _we_ know so much ofthem as we do
the same is true of the more modern reformers andbenefactors of their race
none can be an impartial or wise observer ofhuman life but from the vantage ground of what we should call voluntarypoverty
of a life of luxury the fruit is luxury whether inagriculture or commerce or literature or art
there are nowadaysprofessors of philosophy but not philosophers
yet it is admirable toprofess because it was once admirable to live
to be a philosopher isnot merely to have subtle thoughts nor even to found a school but soto love wisdom as to live according to its dictates a life ofsimplicity independence magnanimity and trust
it is to solve someof the problems of life not only theoretically but practically
thesuccess of great scholars and thinkers is commonly a courtier-likesuccess not kingly not manly
they make shift to live merely byconformity practically as their fathers did and are in no sense theprogenitors of a nobler race of men
but why do men degenerate ever
what makes families run out
what is the nature of the luxury whichenervates and destroys nations
are we sure that there is none of it inour own lives
the philosopher is in advance of his age even in theoutward form of his life
he is not fed sheltered clothed warmedlike his contemporaries
how can a man be a philosopher and notmaintain his vital heat by better methods than other men
when a man is warmed by the several modes which i have described whatdoes he want next
surely not more warmth of the same kind as more andricher food larger and more splendid houses finer and more abundantclothing more numerous incessant and hotter fires and the like
whenhe has obtained those things which are necessary to life there isanother alternative than to obtain the superfluities and that is toadventure on life now his vacation from humbler toil having commenced
the soil it appears is suited to the seed for it has sent itsradicle downward and it may now send its shoot upward also withconfidence
why has man rooted himself thus firmly in the earth butthat he may rise in the same proportion into the heavens above
—for thenobler plants are valued for the fruit they bear at last in the air andlight far from the ground and are not treated like the humbleresculents which though they may be biennials are cultivated onlytill they have perfected their root and often cut down at top for thispurpose so that most would not know them in their flowering season
i do not mean to prescribe rules to strong and valiant natures whowill mind their own affairs whether in heaven or hell and perchancebuild more magnificently and spend more lavishly than the richestwithout ever impoverishing themselves not knowing how they live—ifindeed there are any such as has been dreamed nor to those who findtheir encouragement and inspiration in precisely the present conditionof things and cherish it with the fondness and enthusiasm oflovers—and to some extent i reckon myself in this number i do notspeak to those who are well employed in whatever circumstances andthey know whether they are well employed or not—but mainly to the massof men who are discontented and idly complaining of the hardness oftheir lot or of the times when they might improve them
there are somewho complain most energetically and inconsolably of any because theyare as they say doing their duty
i also have in my mind thatseemingly wealthy but most terribly impoverished class of all whohave accumulated dross but know not how to use it or get rid of itand thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters
if i should attempt to tell how i have desired to spend my life inyears past it would probably surprise those of my readers who aresomewhat acquainted with its actual history it would certainlyastonish those who know nothing about it
i will only hint at some ofthe enterprises which i have cherished
in any weather at any hour of the day or night i have been anxious toimprove the nick of time and notch it on my stick too to stand on themeeting of two eternities the past and future which is precisely thepresent moment to toe that line
you will pardon some obscurities forthere are more secrets in my trade than in most men’s and yet notvoluntarily kept but inseparable from its very nature
i would gladlytell all that i know about it and never paint “no admittance” on mygate
i long ago lost a hound a bay horse and a turtle-dove and am stillon their trail
many are the travellers i have spoken concerning themdescribing their tracks and what calls they answered to
i have met oneor two who had heard the hound and the tramp of the horse and evenseen the dove disappear behind a cloud and they seemed as anxious torecover them as if they had lost them themselves
to anticipate not the sunrise and the dawn merely but if possiblenature herself
how many mornings summer and winter before yet anyneighbor was stirring about his business have i been about mine
nodoubt many of my townsmen have met me returning from this enterprisefarmers starting for boston in the twilight or woodchoppers going totheir work
it is true i never assisted the sun materially in hisrising but doubt not it was of the last importance only to bepresent at it
so many autumn ay and winter days spent outside the town trying tohear what was in the wind to hear and carry it express
i well-nighsunk all my capital in it and lost my own breath into the bargainrunning in the face of it
if it had concerned either of the politicalparties depend upon it it would have appeared in the gazette with theearliest intelligence
at other times watching from the observatory ofsome cliff or tree to telegraph any new arrival or waiting at eveningon the hill-tops for the sky to fall that i might catch somethingthough i never caught much and that manna-wise would dissolve againin the sun
for a long time i was reporter to a journal of no very widecirculation whose editor has never yet seen fit to print the bulk ofmy contributions and as is too common with writers i got only mylabor for my pains
however in this case my pains were their ownreward
for many years i was self-appointed inspector of snow storms and rainstorms and did my duty faithfully surveyor if not of highways thenof forest paths and all across-lot routes keeping them open andravines bridged and passable at all seasons where the public heel hadtestified to their utility
i have looked after the wild stock of the town which give a faithfulherdsman a good deal of trouble by leaping fences and i have had aneye to the unfrequented nooks and corners of the farm though i did notalways know whether jonas or solomon worked in a particular fieldto-day that was none of my business
i have watered the redhuckleberry the sand cherry and the nettle tree the red pine and theblack ash the white grape and the yellow violet which might havewithered else in dry seasons
in short i went on thus for a long time i may say it withoutboasting faithfully minding my business till it became more and moreevident that my townsmen would not after all admit me into the list oftown officers nor make my place a sinecure with a moderate allowance
my accounts which i can swear to have kept faithfully i have indeednever got audited still less accepted still less paid and settled
however i have not set my heart on that
not long since a strolling indian went to sell baskets at the house ofa well-known lawyer in my neighborhood
“do you wish to buy anybaskets
” he asked
“no we do not want any” was the reply
“what
”exclaimed the indian as he went out the gate “do you mean to starveus
” having seen his industrious white neighbors so well off—that thelawyer had only to weave arguments and by some magic wealth andstanding followed he had said to himself i will go into business iwill weave baskets it is a thing which i can do
thinking that when hehad made the baskets he would have done his part and then it would bethe white man’s to buy them
he had not discovered that it wasnecessary for him to make it worth the other’s while to buy them or atleast make him think that it was so or to make something else which itwould be worth his while to buy
i too had woven a kind of basket of adelicate texture but i had not made it worth any one’s while to buythem
yet not the less in my case did i think it worth my while toweave them and instead of studying how to make it worth men’s while tobuy my baskets i studied rather how to avoid the necessity of sellingthem
the life which men praise and regard as successful is but onekind
why should we exaggerate any one kind at the expense of theothers
finding that my fellow-citizens were not likely to offer me any room inthe court house or any curacy or living any where else but i mustshift for myself i turned my face more exclusively than ever to thewoods where i was better known
i determined to go into business atonce and not wait to acquire the usual capital using such slendermeans as i had already got
my purpose in going to walden pond was notto live cheaply nor to live dearly there but to transact some privatebusiness with the fewest obstacles to be hindered from accomplishingwhich for want of a little common sense a little enterprise andbusiness talent appeared not so sad as foolish
i have always endeavored to acquire strict business habits they areindispensable to every man
if your trade is with the celestial empirethen some small counting house on the coast in some salem harbor willbe fixture enough
you will export such articles as the countryaffords purely native products much ice and pine timber and a littlegranite always in native bottoms
these will be good ventures

it is a labor to task the faculties of a man—suchproblems of profit and loss of interest of tare and tret and gaugingof all kinds in it as demand a universal knowledge
i have thought that walden pond would be a good place for business notsolely on account of the railroad and the ice trade it offersadvantages which it may not be good policy to divulge it is a goodport and a good foundation
no neva marshes to be filled though youmust every where build on piles of your own driving
it is said that aflood-tide with a westerly wind and ice in the neva would sweep st
petersburg from the face of the earth
as this business was to be entered into without the usual capital itmay not be easy to conjecture where those means that will still beindispensable to every such undertaking were to be obtained
as forclothing to come at once to the practical part of the questionperhaps we are led oftener by the love of novelty and a regard for theopinions of men in procuring it than by a true utility
let him whohas work to do recollect that the object of clothing is first toretain the vital heat and secondly in this state of society to covernakedness and he may judge how much of any necessary or important workmay be accomplished without adding to his wardrobe
kings and queenswho wear a suit but once though made by some tailor or dressmaker totheir majesties cannot know the comfort of wearing a suit that fits
they are no better than wooden horses to hang the clean clothes on
every day our garments become more assimilated to ourselves receivingthe impress of the wearer’s character until we hesitate to lay themaside without such delay and medical appliances and some suchsolemnity even as our bodies
no man ever stood the lower in myestimation for having a patch in his clothes yet i am sure that thereis greater anxiety commonly to have fashionable or at least cleanand unpatched clothes than to have a sound conscience
but even if therent is not mended perhaps the worst vice betrayed is improvidence
isometimes try my acquaintances by such tests as this—who could wear apatch or two extra seams only over the knee
most behave as if theybelieved that their prospects for life would be ruined if they shoulddo it
it would be easier for them to hobble to town with a broken legthan with a broken pantaloon
often if an accident happens to agentleman’s legs they can be mended but if a similar accident happensto the legs of his pantaloons there is no help for it for heconsiders not what is truly respectable but what is respected
weknow but few men a great many coats and breeches
dress a scarecrow inyour last shift you standing shiftless by who would not soonestsalute the scarecrow
passing a cornfield the other day close by a hatand coat on a stake i recognized the owner of the farm
he was only alittle more weather-beaten than when i saw him last
i have heard of adog that barked at every stranger who approached his master’s premiseswith clothes on but was easily quieted by a naked thief
it is aninteresting question how far men would retain their relative rank ifthey were divested of their clothes
could you in such a case tellsurely of any company of civilized men which belonged to the mostrespected class
when madam pfeiffer in her adventurous travels roundthe world from east to west had got so near home as asiatic russiashe says that she felt the necessity of wearing other than a travellingdress when she went to meet the authorities for she “was now in acivilized country where —— — people are judged of by their clothes
”even in our democratic new england towns the accidental possession ofwealth and its manifestation in dress and equipage alone obtain forthe possessor almost universal respect
but they yield such respectnumerous as they are are so far heathen and need to have a missionarysent to them
beside clothes introduced sewing a kind of work whichyou may call endless a woman’s dress at least is never done
a man who has at length found something to do will not need to get anew suit to do it in for him the old will do that has lain dusty inthe garret for an indeterminate period
old shoes will serve a herolonger than they have served his valet—if a hero ever has avalet—bare feet are older than shoes and he can make them do
onlythey who go to soirées and legislative halls must have new coats coatsto change as often as the man changes in them
but if my jacket andtrousers my hat and shoes are fit to worship god in they will dowill they not
who ever saw his old clothes—his old coat actuallyworn out resolved into its primitive elements so that it was not adeed of charity to bestow it on some poor boy by him perchance to bebestowed on some poorer still or shall we say richer who could dowith less
i say beware of all enterprises that require new clothesand not rather a new wearer of clothes
if there is not a new man howcan the new clothes be made to fit
if you have any enterprise beforeyou try it in your old clothes
all men want not something to _dowith_ but something to _do_ or rather something to _be_
perhaps weshould never procure a new suit however ragged or dirty the old untilwe have so conducted so enterprised or sailed in some way that wefeel like new men in the old and that to retain it would be likekeeping new wine in old bottles
our moulting season like that of thefowls must be a crisis in our lives

it is desirable that aman be clad so simply that he can lay his hands on himself in the darkand that he live in all respects so compactly and preparedly that ifan enemy take the town he can like the old philosopher walk out thegate empty-handed without anxiety

when i ask for a garment of a particular form my tailoress tells megravely “they do not make them so now” not emphasizing the “they” atall as if she quoted an authority as impersonal as the fates and ifind it difficult to get made what i want simply because she cannotbelieve that i mean what i say that i am so rash
when i hear thisoracular sentence i am for a moment absorbed in thought emphasizingto myself each word separately that i may come at the meaning of itthat i may find out by what degree of consanguinity _they_ are relatedto _me_ and what authority they may have in an affair which affects meso nearly and finally i am inclined to answer her with equalmystery and without any more emphasis of the “they”—“it is true theydid not make them so recently but they do now

on the whole i think that it cannot be maintained that dressing has inthis or any country risen to the dignity of an art
at present men makeshift to wear what they can get
like shipwrecked sailors they put onwhat they can find on the beach and at a little distance whether ofspace or time laugh at each other’s masquerade

in the long run men hit only what theyaim at
therefore though they should fail immediately they had betteraim at something high
as for a shelter i will not deny that this is now a necessary of lifethough there are instances of men having done without it for longperiods in colder countries than this
samuel laing says that “thelaplander in his skin dress and in a skin bag which he puts over hishead and shoulders will sleep night after night on the snow—in adegree of cold which would extinguish the life of one exposed to it inany woollen clothing

yet he adds “theyare not hardier than other people
” but probably man did not livelong on the earth without discovering the convenience which there is ina house the domestic comforts which phrase may have originallysignified the satisfactions of the house more than of the familythough these must be extremely partial and occasional in those climateswhere the house is associated in our thoughts with winter or the rainyseason chiefly and two thirds of the year except for a parasol isunnecessary

formerly when how to get my livinghonestly with freedom left for my proper pursuits was a questionwhich vexed me even more than it does now for unfortunately i ambecome somewhat callous i used to see a large box by the railroad sixfeet long by three wide in which the laborers locked up their tools atnight and it suggested to me that every man who was hard pushed mightget such a one for a dollar and having bored a few auger holes in itto admit the air at least get into it when it rained and at night andhook down the lid and so have freedom in his love and in his soul befree

many a man is harassed to death to pay the rent of a larger andmore luxurious box who would not have frozen to death in such a box asthis
i am far from jesting
economy is a subject which admits of beingtreated with levity but it cannot so be disposed of
a comfortablehouse for a rude and hardy race that lived mostly out of doors wasonce made here almost entirely of such materials as nature furnishedready to their hands
gookin who was superintendent of the indianssubject to the massachusetts colony writing in 1674 says “the bestof their houses are covered very neatly tight and warm with barks oftrees slipped from their bodies at those seasons when the sap is upand made into great flakes with pressure of weighty timber when theyare green



the meaner sort are covered with mats which they make ofa kind of bulrush and are also indifferently tight and warm but notso good as the former



some i have seen sixty or a hundred feetlong and thirty feet broad



i have often lodged in their wigwamsand found them as warm as the best english houses
” he adds that theywere commonly carpeted and lined within with well-wrought embroideredmats and were furnished with various utensils
the indians hadadvanced so far as to regulate the effect of the wind by a matsuspended over the hole in the roof and moved by a string
such a lodgewas in the first instance constructed in a day or two at most andtaken down and put up in a few hours and every family owned one orits apartment in one
in the savage state every family owns a shelter as good as the bestand sufficient for its coarser and simpler wants but i think that ispeak within bounds when i say that though the birds of the air havetheir nests and the foxes their holes and the savages their wigwamsin modern civilized society not more than one half the families own ashelter
in the large towns and cities where civilization especiallyprevails the number of those who own a shelter is a very smallfraction of the whole
the rest pay an annual tax for this outsidegarment of all become indispensable summer and winter which would buya village of indian wigwams but now helps to keep them poor as long asthey live
i do not mean to insist here on the disadvantage of hiringcompared with owning but it is evident that the savage owns hisshelter because it costs so little while the civilized man hires hiscommonly because he cannot afford to own it nor can he in the longrun any better afford to hire
but answers one by merely paying thistax the poor civilized man secures an abode which is a palace comparedwith the savage’s
an annual rent of from twenty-five to a hundreddollars these are the country rates entitles him to the benefit ofthe improvements of centuries spacious apartments clean paint andpaper rumford fireplace back plastering venetian blinds copperpump spring lock a commodious cellar and many other things
but howhappens it that he who is said to enjoy these things is so commonly a_poor_ civilized man while the savage who has them not is rich as asavage
if it is asserted that civilization is a real advance in thecondition of man—and i think that it is though only the wise improvetheir advantages—it must be shown that it has produced betterdwellings without making them more costly and the cost of a thing isthe amount of what i will call life which is required to be exchangedfor it immediately or in the long run
an average house in thisneighborhood costs perhaps eight hundred dollars and to lay up thissum will take from ten to fifteen years of the laborer’s life even ifhe is not encumbered with a family—estimating the pecuniary value ofevery man’s labor at one dollar a day for if some receive more othersreceive less—so that he must have spent more than half his lifecommonly before _his_ wigwam will be earned
if we suppose him to pay arent instead this is but a doubtful choice of evils
would the savagehave been wise to exchange his wigwam for a palace on these terms
it may be guessed that i reduce almost the whole advantage of holdingthis superfluous property as a fund in store against the future so faras the individual is concerned mainly to the defraying of funeralexpenses
but perhaps a man is not required to bury himself
nevertheless this points to an important distinction between thecivilized man and the savage and no doubt they have designs on usfor our benefit in making the life of a civilized people an_institution_ in which the life of the individual is to a great extentabsorbed in order to preserve and perfect that of the race
but i wishto show at what a sacrifice this advantage is at present obtained andto suggest that we may possibly so live as to secure all the advantagewithout suffering any of the disadvantage
what mean ye by saying thatthe poor ye have always with you or that the fathers have eaten sourgrapes and the children’s teeth are set on edge
“as i live saith the lord god ye shall not have occasion any more touse this proverb in israel
”“behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soulof the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die
”when i consider my neighbors the farmers of concord who are at leastas well off as the other classes i find that for the most part theyhave been toiling twenty thirty or forty years that they may becomethe real owners of their farms which commonly they have inherited withencumbrances or else bought with hired money—and we may regard onethird of that toil as the cost of their houses—but commonly they havenot paid for them yet
it is true the encumbrances sometimes outweighthe value of the farm so that the farm itself becomes one greatencumbrance and still a man is found to inherit it being wellacquainted with it as he says
on applying to the assessors i amsurprised to learn that they cannot at once name a dozen in the townwho own their farms free and clear
if you would know the history ofthese homesteads inquire at the bank where they are mortgaged
the manwho has actually paid for his farm with labor on it is so rare thatevery neighbor can point to him
i doubt if there are three such men inconcord
what has been said of the merchants that a very largemajority even ninety-seven in a hundred are sure to fail is equallytrue of the farmers
with regard to the merchants however one of themsays pertinently that a great part of their failures are not genuinepecuniary failures but merely failures to fulfil their engagementsbecause it is inconvenient that is it is the moral character thatbreaks down
but this puts an infinitely worse face on the matter andsuggests beside that probably not even the other three succeed insaving their souls but are perchance bankrupt in a worse sense thanthey who fail honestly
bankruptcy and repudiation are the springboardsfrom which much of our civilization vaults and turns its somersets butthe savage stands on the unelastic plank of famine
yet the middlesexcattle show goes off here with _éclat_ annually as if all the jointsof the agricultural machine were suent
the farmer is endeavoring to solve the problem of a livelihood by aformula more complicated than the problem itself
to get hisshoestrings he speculates in herds of cattle
with consummate skill hehas set his trap with a hair spring to catch comfort and independenceand then as he turned away got his own leg into it
this is thereason he is poor and for a similar reason we are all poor in respectto a thousand savage comforts though surrounded by luxuries
aschapman sings—     “the false society of men—             —for earthly greatness     all heavenly comforts rarefies to air
”and when the farmer has got his house he may not be the richer but thepoorer for it and it be the house that has got him
as i understandit that was a valid objection urged by momus against the house whichminerva made that she “had not made it movable by which means a badneighborhood might be avoided” and it may still be urged for ourhouses are such unwieldy property that we are often imprisoned ratherthan housed in them and the bad neighborhood to be avoided is our ownscurvy selves
i know one or two families at least in this town whofor nearly a generation have been wishing to sell their houses in theoutskirts and move into the village but have not been able toaccomplish it and only death will set them free
granted that the _majority_ are able at last either to own or hire themodern house with all its improvements
while civilization has beenimproving our houses it has not equally improved the men who are toinhabit them
it has created palaces but it was not so easy to createnoblemen and kings
and _if the civilized man’s pursuits are noworthier than the savage’s if he is employed the greater part of hislife in obtaining gross necessaries and comforts merely why should hehave a better dwelling than the former
_but how do the poor minority fare
perhaps it will be found that justin proportion as some have been placed in outward circumstances abovethe savage others have been degraded below him
the luxury of oneclass is counterbalanced by the indigence of another
on the one sideis the palace on the other are the almshouse and “silent poor
” themyriads who built the pyramids to be the tombs of the pharaohs were fedon garlic and it may be were not decently buried themselves
the masonwho finishes the cornice of the palace returns at night perchance to ahut not so good as a wigwam
it is a mistake to suppose that in acountry where the usual evidences of civilization exist the conditionof a very large body of the inhabitants may not be as degraded as thatof savages
i refer to the degraded poor not now to the degraded rich
to know this i should not need to look farther than to the shantieswhich every where border our railroads that last improvement incivilization where i see in my daily walks human beings living insties and all winter with an open door for the sake of light withoutany visible often imaginable wood pile and the forms of both old andyoung are permanently contracted by the long habit of shrinking fromcold and misery and the development of all their limbs and facultiesis checked
it certainly is fair to look at that class by whose laborthe works which distinguish this generation are accomplished
such tooto a greater or less extent is the condition of the operatives ofevery denomination in england which is the great workhouse of theworld
or i could refer you to ireland which is marked as one of thewhite or enlightened spots on the map
contrast the physical conditionof the irish with that of the north american indian or the south seaislander or any other savage race before it was degraded by contactwith the civilized man
yet i have no doubt that that people’s rulersare as wise as the average of civilized rulers
their condition onlyproves what squalidness may consist with civilization
i hardly needrefer now to the laborers in our southern states who produce the stapleexports of this country and are themselves a staple production of thesouth
but to confine myself to those who are said to be in _moderate_circumstances
most men appear never to have considered what a house is and areactually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think thatthey must have such a one as their neighbors have
as if one were towear any sort of coat which the tailor might cut out for him orgradually leaving off palmleaf hat or cap of woodchuck skin complainof hard times because he could not afford to buy him a crown
it ispossible to invent a house still more convenient and luxurious than wehave which yet all would admit that man could not afford to pay for
shall we always study to obtain more of these things and not sometimesto be content with less
shall the respectable citizen thus gravelyteach by precept and example the necessity of the young man’sproviding a certain number of superfluous glow-shoes and umbrellasand empty guest chambers for empty guests before he dies
why shouldnot our furniture be as simple as the arab’s or the indian’s
when ithink of the benefactors of the race whom we have apotheosized asmessengers from heaven bearers of divine gifts to man i do not see inmy mind any retinue at their heels any car-load of fashionablefurniture
or what if i were to allow—would it not be a singularallowance
—that our furniture should be more complex than the arab’sin proportion as we are morally and intellectually his superiors
atpresent our houses are cluttered and defiled with it and a goodhousewife would sweep out the greater part into the dust hole and notleave her morning’s work undone

i had three pieces of limestone on my desk but i was terrifiedto find that they required to be dusted daily when the furniture of mymind was all undusted still and i threw them out the window indisgust
how then could i have a furnished house
i would rather sitin the open air for no dust gathers on the grass unless where man hasbroken ground
it is the luxurious and dissipated who set the fashions which the herdso diligently follow
the traveller who stops at the best houses socalled soon discovers this for the publicans presume him to be asardanapalus and if he resigned himself to their tender mercies hewould soon be completely emasculated
i think that in the railroad carwe are inclined to spend more on luxury than on safety and convenienceand it threatens without attaining these to become no better than amodern drawing room with its divans and ottomans and sun-shades anda hundred other oriental things which we are taking west with usinvented for the ladies of the harem and the effeminate natives of thecelestial empire which jonathan should be ashamed to know the namesof
i would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than becrowded on a velvet cushion
i would rather ride on earth in an ox cartwith a free circulation than go to heaven in the fancy car of anexcursion train and breathe a _malaria_ all the way
the very simplicity and nakedness of man’s life in the primitive agesimply this advantage at least that they left him still but a sojournerin nature
when he was refreshed with food and sleep he contemplatedhis journey again
he dwelt as it were in a tent in this world andwas either threading the valleys or crossing the plains or climbingthe mountain tops
but lo
men have become the tools of their tools
the man who independently plucked the fruits when he was hungry isbecome a farmer and he who stood under a tree for shelter ahousekeeper
we now no longer camp as for a night but have settleddown on earth and forgotten heaven
we have adopted christianity merelyas an improved method of _agri_-culture
we have built for this world afamily mansion and for the next a family tomb
the best works of artare the expression of man’s struggle to free himself from thiscondition but the effect of our art is merely to make this low statecomfortable and that higher state to be forgotten
there is actually noplace in this village for a work of _fine_ art if any had come down tous to stand for our lives our houses and streets furnish no properpedestal for it
there is not a nail to hang a picture on nor a shelfto receive the bust of a hero or a saint
when i consider how ourhouses are built and paid for or not paid for and their internaleconomy managed and sustained i wonder that the floor does not giveway under the visitor while he is admiring the gewgaws upon themantel-piece and let him through into the cellar to some solid andhonest though earthy foundation
i cannot but perceive that this socalled rich and refined life is a thing jumped at and i do not get onin the enjoyment of the _fine_ arts which adorn it my attention beingwholly occupied with the jump for i remember that the greatest genuineleap due to human muscles alone on record is that of certainwandering arabs who are said to have cleared twenty-five feet on levelground
without factitious support man is sure to come to earth againbeyond that distance
the first question which i am tempted to put tothe proprietor of such great impropriety is who bolsters you
are youone of the ninety-seven who fail or of the three who succeed
answerme these questions and then perhaps i may look at your bawbles andfind them ornamental
the cart before the horse is neither beautifulnor useful
before we can adorn our houses with beautiful objects thewalls must be stripped and our lives must be stripped and beautifulhousekeeping and beautiful living be laid for a foundation now ataste for the beautiful is most cultivated out of doors where there isno house and no housekeeper
old johnson in his “wonder-working providence” speaking of the firstsettlers of this town with whom he was contemporary tells us that“they burrow themselves in the earth for their first shelter under somehillside and casting the soil aloft upon timber they make a smokyfire against the earth at the highest side
” they did not “providethem houses” says he “till the earth by the lord’s blessing broughtforth bread to feed them” and the first year’s crop was so light that“they were forced to cut their bread very thin for a long season
” thesecretary of the province of new netherland writing in dutch in 1650for the information of those who wished to take up land there statesmore particularly that “those in new netherland and especially in newengland who have no means to build farmhouses at first according totheir wishes dig a square pit in the ground cellar fashion six orseven feet deep as long and as broad as they think proper case theearth inside with wood all round the wall and line the wood with thebark of trees or something else to prevent the caving in of the earthfloor this cellar with plank and wainscot it overhead for a ceilingraise a roof of spars clear up and cover the spars with bark or greensods so that they can live dry and warm in these houses with theirentire families for two three and four years it being understoodthat partitions are run through those cellars which are adapted to thesize of the family
the wealthy and principal men in new england inthe beginning of the colonies commenced their first dwelling houses inthis fashion for two reasons firstly in order not to waste time inbuilding and not to want food the next season secondly in order notto discourage poor laboring people whom they brought over in numbersfrom fatherland
in the course of three or four years when the countrybecame adapted to agriculture they built themselves handsome housesspending on them several thousands
”in this course which our ancestors took there was a show of prudence atleast as if their principle were to satisfy the more pressing wantsfirst
but are the more pressing wants satisfied now
when i think ofacquiring for myself one of our luxurious dwellings i am deterredfor so to speak the country is not yet adapted to _human_ cultureand we are still forced to cut our _spiritual_ bread far thinner thanour forefathers did their wheaten
not that all architectural ornamentis to be neglected even in the rudest periods but let our houses firstbe lined with beauty where they come in contact with our lives likethe tenement of the shellfish and not overlaid with it
but alas
ihave been inside one or two of them and know what they are lined with
though we are not so degenerate but that we might possibly live in acave or a wigwam or wear skins today it certainly is better to acceptthe advantages though so dearly bought which the invention andindustry of mankind offer
in such a neighborhood as this boards andshingles lime and bricks are cheaper and more easily obtained thansuitable caves or whole logs or bark in sufficient quantities oreven well-tempered clay or flat stones
i speak understandingly on thissubject for i have made myself acquainted with it both theoreticallyand practically
with a little more wit we might use these materials soas to become richer than the richest now are and make our civilizationa blessing
the civilized man is a more experienced and wiser savage
but to make haste to my own experiment
near the end of march 1845 i borrowed an axe and went down to thewoods by walden pond nearest to where i intended to build my houseand began to cut down some tall arrowy white pines still in theiryouth for timber
it is difficult to begin without borrowing butperhaps it is the most generous course thus to permit your fellow-mento have an interest in your enterprise
the owner of the axe as hereleased his hold on it said that it was the apple of his eye but ireturned it sharper than i received it
it was a pleasant hillsidewhere i worked covered with pine woods through which i looked out onthe pond and a small open field in the woods where pines and hickorieswere springing up
the ice in the pond was not yet dissolved thoughthere were some open spaces and it was all dark colored and saturatedwith water
there were some slight flurries of snow during the daysthat i worked there but for the most part when i came out on to therailroad on my way home its yellow sand heap stretched away gleamingin the hazy atmosphere and the rails shone in the spring sun and iheard the lark and pewee and other birds already come to commenceanother year with us
they were pleasant spring days in which thewinter of man’s discontent was thawing as well as the earth and thelife that had lain torpid began to stretch itself
one day when my axehad come off and i had cut a green hickory for a wedge driving it witha stone and had placed the whole to soak in a pond hole in order toswell the wood i saw a striped snake run into the water and he lay onthe bottom apparently without inconvenience as long as i stayedthere or more than a quarter of an hour perhaps because he had notyet fairly come out of the torpid state
it appeared to me that for alike reason men remain in their present low and primitive conditionbut if they should feel the influence of the spring of springs arousingthem they would of necessity rise to a higher and more ethereal life
i had previously seen the snakes in frosty mornings in my path withportions of their bodies still numb and inflexible waiting for the sunto thaw them
on the 1st of april it rained and melted the ice and inthe early part of the day which was very foggy i heard a stray goosegroping about over the pond and cackling as if lost or like the spiritof the fog
so i went on for some days cutting and hewing timber and also studsand rafters all with my narrow axe not having many communicable orscholar-like thoughts singing to myself—     men say they know many things     but lo
they have taken wings—     the arts and sciences     and a thousand appliances     the wind that blows     is all that any body knows
i hewed the main timbers six inches square most of the studs on twosides only and the rafters and floor timbers on one side leaving therest of the bark on so that they were just as straight and muchstronger than sawed ones
each stick was carefully mortised or tenonedby its stump for i had borrowed other tools by this time
my days inthe woods were not very long ones yet i usually carried my dinner ofbread and butter and read the newspaper in which it was wrapped atnoon sitting amid the green pine boughs which i had cut off and to mybread was imparted some of their fragrance for my hands were coveredwith a thick coat of pitch
before i had done i was more the friendthan the foe of the pine tree though i had cut down some of themhaving become better acquainted with it
sometimes a rambler in thewood was attracted by the sound of my axe and we chatted pleasantlyover the chips which i had made
by the middle of april for i made no haste in my work but rather madethe most of it my house was framed and ready for the raising
i hadalready bought the shanty of james collins an irishman who worked onthe fitchburg railroad for boards
james collins’ shanty wasconsidered an uncommonly fine one
when i called to see it he was notat home
i walked about the outside at first unobserved from withinthe window was so deep and high
it was of small dimensions with apeaked cottage roof and not much else to be seen the dirt beingraised five feet all around as if it were a compost heap
the roof wasthe soundest part though a good deal warped and made brittle by thesun
door-sill there was none but a perennial passage for the hensunder the door board
mrs
c
came to the door and asked me to view itfrom the inside
the hens were driven in by my approach
it was darkand had a dirt floor for the most part dank clammy and aguish onlyhere a board and there a board which would not bear removal
shelighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof and the walls andalso that the board floor extended under the bed warning me not tostep into the cellar a sort of dust hole two feet deep
in her ownwords they were “good boards overhead good boards all around and agood window”—of two whole squares originally only the cat had passedout that way lately
there was a stove a bed and a place to sit aninfant in the house where it was born a silk parasol gilt-framedlooking-glass and a patent new coffee mill nailed to an oak saplingall told
the bargain was soon concluded for james had in themeanwhile returned
i to pay four dollars and twenty-five centsto-night he to vacate at five to-morrow morning selling to nobodyelse meanwhile i to take possession at six
it were well he said tobe there early and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly unjustclaims on the score of ground rent and fuel
this he assured me was theonly encumbrance
at six i passed him and his family on the road
onelarge bundle held their all—bed coffee-mill looking-glass hens—allbut the cat she took to the woods and became a wild cat and as ilearned afterward trod in a trap set for woodchucks and so became adead cat at last
i took down this dwelling the same morning drawing the nails andremoved it to the pond side by small cartloads spreading the boards onthe grass there to bleach and warp back again in the sun
one earlythrush gave me a note or two as i drove along the woodland path
i wasinformed treacherously by a young patrick that neighbor seeley anirishman in the intervals of the carting transferred the stilltolerable straight and drivable nails staples and spikes to hispocket and then stood when i came back to pass the time of day andlook freshly up unconcerned with spring thoughts at the devastationthere being a dearth of work as he said
he was there to representspectatordom and help make this seemingly insignificant event one withthe removal of the gods of troy
i dug my cellar in the side of a hill sloping to the south where awoodchuck had formerly dug his burrow down through sumach andblackberry roots and the lowest stain of vegetation six feet squareby seven deep to a fine sand where potatoes would not freeze in anywinter
the sides were left shelving and not stoned but the sunhaving never shone on them the sand still keeps its place
it was buttwo hours’ work
i took particular pleasure in this breaking of groundfor in almost all latitudes men dig into the earth for an equabletemperature
under the most splendid house in the city is still to befound the cellar where they store their roots as of old and long afterthe superstructure has disappeared posterity remark its dent in theearth
the house is still but a sort of porch at the entrance of aburrow
at length in the beginning of may with the help of some of myacquaintances rather to improve so good an occasion for neighborlinessthan from any necessity i set up the frame of my house
no man wasever more honored in the character of his raisers than i
they aredestined i trust to assist at the raising of loftier structures oneday
i began to occupy my house on the 4th of july as soon as it wasboarded and roofed for the boards were carefully feather-edged andlapped so that it was perfectly impervious to rain but beforeboarding i laid the foundation of a chimney at one end bringing twocartloads of stones up the hill from the pond in my arms
i built thechimney after my hoeing in the fall before a fire became necessary forwarmth doing my cooking in the mean while out of doors on the groundearly in the morning which mode i still think is in some respects moreconvenient and agreeable than the usual one
when it stormed before mybread was baked i fixed a few boards over the fire and sat under themto watch my loaf and passed some pleasant hours in that way
in thosedays when my hands were much employed i read but little but theleast scraps of paper which lay on the ground my holder ortablecloth afforded me as much entertainment in fact answered thesame purpose as the iliad
it would be worth the while to build still more deliberately than idid considering for instance what foundation a door a window acellar a garret have in the nature of man and perchance neverraising any superstructure until we found a better reason for it thanour temporal necessities even
there is some of the same fitness in aman’s building his own house that there is in a bird’s building its ownnest
who knows but if men constructed their dwellings with their ownhands and provided food for themselves and families simply andhonestly enough the poetic faculty would be universally developed asbirds universally sing when they are so engaged
but alas
we do likecowbirds and cuckoos which lay their eggs in nests which other birdshave built and cheer no traveller with their chattering and unmusicalnotes
shall we forever resign the pleasure of construction to thecarpenter
what does architecture amount to in the experience of themass of men
i never in all my walks came across a man engaged in sosimple and natural an occupation as building his house
we belong tothe community
it is not the tailor alone who is the ninth part of aman it is as much the preacher and the merchant and the farmer
where is this division of labor to end
and what object does it finallyserve
no doubt another _may_ also think for me but it is nottherefore desirable that he should do so to the exclusion of mythinking for myself
true there are architects so called in this country and i have heardof one at least possessed with the idea of making architecturalornaments have a core of truth a necessity and hence a beauty as ifit were a revelation to him
all very well perhaps from his point ofview but only a little better than the common dilettantism
asentimental reformer in architecture he began at the cornice not atthe foundation
it was only how to put a core of truth within theornaments that every sugar plum in fact might have an almond orcaraway seed in it—though i hold that almonds are most wholesomewithout the sugar—and not how the inhabitant the indweller mightbuild truly within and without and let the ornaments take care ofthemselves
what reasonable man ever supposed that ornaments weresomething outward and in the skin merely—that the tortoise got hisspotted shell or the shellfish its mother-o’-pearl tints by such acontract as the inhabitants of broadway their trinity church
but a manhas no more to do with the style of architecture of his house than atortoise with that of its shell nor need the soldier be so idle as totry to paint the precise color of his virtue on his standard
the enemywill find it out
he may turn pale when the trial comes
this manseemed to me to lean over the cornice and timidly whisper his halftruth to the rude occupants who really knew it better than he
what ofarchitectural beauty i now see i know has gradually grown from withinoutward out of the necessities and character of the indweller who isthe only builder—out of some unconscious truthfulness and noblenesswithout ever a thought for the appearance and whatever additionalbeauty of this kind is destined to be produced will be preceded by alike unconscious beauty of life
the most interesting dwellings in thiscountry as the painter knows are the most unpretending humble loghuts and cottages of the poor commonly it is the life of theinhabitants whose shells they are and not any peculiarity in theirsurfaces merely which makes them _picturesque_ and equallyinteresting will be the citizen’s suburban box when his life shall beas simple and as agreeable to the imagination and there is as littlestraining after effect in the style of his dwelling
a great proportionof architectural ornaments are literally hollow and a september galewould strip them off like borrowed plumes without injury to thesubstantials
they can do without _architecture_ who have no olives norwines in the cellar
what if an equal ado were made about the ornamentsof style in literature and the architects of our bibles spent as muchtime about their cornices as the architects of our churches do
so aremade the _belles-lettres_ and the _beaux-arts_ and their professors
much it concerns a man forsooth how a few sticks are slanted over himor under him and what colors are daubed upon his box
it would signifysomewhat if in any earnest sense _he_ slanted them and daubed itbut the spirit having departed out of the tenant it is of a piece withconstructing his own coffin—the architecture of the grave and“carpenter” is but another name for “coffin-maker
” one man says inhis despair or indifference to life take up a handful of the earth atyour feet and paint your house that color
is he thinking of his lastand narrow house
toss up a copper for it as well
what an abundance ofleisure he must have
why do you take up a handful of dirt
betterpaint your house your own complexion let it turn pale or blush foryou
an enterprise to improve the style of cottage architecture
whenyou have got my ornaments ready i will wear them
before winter i built a chimney and shingled the sides of my housewhich were already impervious to rain with imperfect and sappyshingles made of the first slice of the log whose edges i was obligedto straighten with a plane
i have thus a tight shingled and plastered house ten feet wide byfifteen long and eight-feet posts with a garret and a closet a largewindow on each side two trap doors one door at the end and a brickfireplace opposite
the exact cost of my house paying the usual pricefor such materials as i used but not counting the work all of whichwas done by myself was as follows and i give the details because veryfew are able to tell exactly what their houses cost and fewer stillif any the separate cost of the various materials which compose them—    boards

i intend to build me a house which will surpass any on the main streetin concord in grandeur and luxury as soon as it pleases me as much andwill cost me no more than my present one
i thus found that the student who wishes for a shelter can obtain onefor a lifetime at an expense not greater than the rent which he nowpays annually
if i seem to boast more than is becoming my excuse isthat i brag for humanity rather than for myself and my shortcomingsand inconsistencies do not affect the truth of my statement
notwithstanding much cant and hypocrisy—chaff which i find itdifficult to separate from my wheat but for which i am as sorry as anyman—i will breathe freely and stretch myself in this respect it issuch a relief to both the moral and physical system and i am resolvedthat i will not through humility become the devil’s attorney
i willendeavor to speak a good word for the truth
at cambridge college themere rent of a student’s room which is only a little larger than myown is thirty dollars each year though the corporation had theadvantage of building thirty-two side by side and under one roof andthe occupant suffers the inconvenience of many and noisy neighbors andperhaps a residence in the fourth story
i cannot but think that if wehad more true wisdom in these respects not only less education wouldbe needed because forsooth more would already have been acquiredbut the pecuniary expense of getting an education would in a greatmeasure vanish
those conveniences which the student requires atcambridge or elsewhere cost him or somebody else ten times as great asacrifice of life as they would with proper management on both sides
those things for which the most money is demanded are never the thingswhich the student most wants
tuition for instance is an importantitem in the term bill while for the far more valuable education whichhe gets by associating with the most cultivated of his contemporariesno charge is made
the mode of founding a college is commonly to getup a subscription of dollars and cents and then following blindly theprinciples of a division of labor to its extreme a principle whichshould never be followed but with circumspection—to call in acontractor who makes this a subject of speculation and he employsirishmen or other operatives actually to lay the foundations while thestudents that are to be are said to be fitting themselves for it andfor these oversights successive generations have to pay
i think thatit would be _better than this_ for the students or those who desireto be benefited by it even to lay the foundation themselves
thestudent who secures his coveted leisure and retirement bysystematically shirking any labor necessary to man obtains but anignoble and unprofitable leisure defrauding himself of the experiencewhich alone can make leisure fruitful
“but” says one “you do notmean that the students should go to work with their hands instead oftheir heads
” i do not mean that exactly but i mean something which hemight think a good deal like that i mean that they should not _play_life or _study_ it merely while the community supports them at thisexpensive game but earnestly _live_ it from beginning to end
howcould youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experimentof living
methinks this would exercise their minds as much asmathematics
if i wished a boy to know something about the arts andsciences for instance i would not pursue the common course which ismerely to send him into the neighborhood of some professor where anything is professed and practised but the art of life—to survey theworld through a telescope or a microscope and never with his naturaleye to study chemistry and not learn how his bread is made ormechanics and not learn how it is earned to discover new satellitesto neptune and not detect the motes in his eyes or to what vagabondhe is a satellite himself or to be devoured by the monsters that swarmall around him while contemplating the monsters in a drop of vinegar
which would have advanced the most at the end of a month—the boy whohad made his own jackknife from the ore which he had dug and smeltedreading as much as would be necessary for this—or the boy who hadattended the lectures on metallurgy at the institute in the mean whileand had received a rodgers’ penknife from his father
which would bemost likely to cut his fingers



to my astonishment i was informed onleaving college that i had studied navigation
—why if i had taken oneturn down the harbor i should have known more about it

as with our colleges so with a hundred “modern improvements” there isan illusion about them there is not always a positive advance
thedevil goes on exacting compound interest to the last for his earlyshare and numerous succeeding investments in them

” but i am wiser than that
i have learned that the swiftesttraveller is he that goes afoot
i say to my friend suppose we try whowill get there first
the distance is thirty miles the fare ninetycents
that is almost a day’s wages
i remember when wages were sixtycents a day for laborers on this very road
well i start now on footand get there before night i have travelled at that rate by the weektogether
you will in the mean while have earned your fare and arrivethere some time to-morrow or possibly this evening if you are luckyenough to get a job in season
instead of going to fitchburg you willbe working here the greater part of the day
and so if the railroadreached round the world i think that i should keep ahead of you andas for seeing the country and getting experience of that kind i shouldhave to cut your acquaintance altogether
such is the universal law which no man can ever outwit and withregard to the railroad even we may say it is as broad as it is long
tomake a railroad round the world available to all mankind is equivalentto grading the whole surface of the planet
men have an indistinctnotion that if they keep up this activity of joint stocks and spadeslong enough all will at length ride somewhere in next to no time andfor nothing but though a crowd rushes to the depot and the conductorshouts “all aboard
” when the smoke is blown away and the vaporcondensed it will be perceived that a few are riding but the rest arerun over—and it will be called and will be “a melancholy accident
”no doubt they can ride at last who shall have earned their fare thatis if they survive so long but they will probably have lost theirelasticity and desire to travel by that time
this spending of the bestpart of one’s life earning money in order to enjoy a questionableliberty during the least valuable part of it reminds me of theenglishman who went to india to make a fortune first in order that hemight return to england and live the life of a poet

before i finished my house wishing to earn ten or twelve dollars bysome honest and agreeable method in order to meet my unusual expensesi planted about two acres and a half of light and sandy soil near itchiefly with beans but also a small part with potatoes corn peasand turnips
the whole lot contains eleven acres mostly growing up topines and hickories and was sold the preceding season for eightdollars and eight cents an acre
one farmer said that it was “good fornothing but to raise cheeping squirrels on
” i put no manure whateveron this land not being the owner but merely a squatter and notexpecting to cultivate so much again and i did not quite hoe it allonce
i got out several cords of stumps in ploughing which supplied mewith fuel for a long time and left small circles of virgin mouldeasily distinguishable through the summer by the greater luxuriance ofthe beans there
the dead and for the most part unmerchantable woodbehind my house and the driftwood from the pond have supplied theremainder of my fuel

50—the amount on hand much more than balancing alittle grass which i did not raise
all things considered that isconsidering the importance of a man’s soul and of to-daynotwithstanding the short time occupied by my experiment nay partlyeven because of its transient character i believe that that was doingbetter than any farmer in concord did that year
the next year i did better still for i spaded up all the land which irequired about a third of an acre and i learned from the experienceof both years not being in the least awed by many celebrated works onhusbandry arthur young among the rest that if one would live simplyand eat only the crop which he raised and raise no more than he ateand not exchange it for an insufficient quantity of more luxurious andexpensive things he would need to cultivate only a few rods of groundand that it would be cheaper to spade up that than to use oxen toplough it and to select a fresh spot from time to time than to manurethe old and he could do all his necessary farm work as it were withhis left hand at odd hours in the summer and thus he would not be tiedto an ox or horse or cow or pig as at present
i desire to speakimpartially on this point and as one not interested in the success orfailure of the present economical and social arrangements
i was moreindependent than any farmer in concord for i was not anchored to ahouse or farm but could follow the bent of my genius which is a verycrooked one every moment
beside being better off than they alreadyif my house had been burned or my crops had failed i should have beennearly as well off as before
i am wont to think that men are not so much the keepers of herds asherds are the keepers of men the former are so much the freer
men andoxen exchange work but if we consider necessary work only the oxenwill be seen to have greatly the advantage their farm is so much thelarger
man does some of his part of the exchange work in his six weeksof haying and it is no boy’s play
certainly no nation that livedsimply in all respects that is no nation of philosophers wouldcommit so great a blunder as to use the labor of animals
true therenever was and is not likely soon to be a nation of philosophers nor ami certain it is desirable that there should be
however _i_ shouldnever have broken a horse or bull and taken him to board for any workhe might do for me for fear i should become a horse-man or a herds-manmerely and if society seems to be the gainer by so doing are wecertain that what is one man’s gain is not another’s loss and that thestable-boy has equal cause with his master to be satisfied
grantedthat some public works would not have been constructed without thisaid and let man share the glory of such with the ox and horse does itfollow that he could not have accomplished works yet more worthy ofhimself in that case
when men begin to do not merely unnecessary orartistic but luxurious and idle work with their assistance it isinevitable that a few do all the exchange work with the oxen or inother words become the slaves of the strongest
man thus not onlyworks for the animal within him but for a symbol of this he worksfor the animal without him
though we have many substantial houses ofbrick or stone the prosperity of the farmer is still measured by thedegree to which the barn overshadows the house
this town is said tohave the largest houses for oxen cows and horses hereabouts and itis not behindhand in its public buildings but there are very few hallsfor free worship or free speech in this county

these statistics however accidental and therefore uninstructive theymay appear as they have a certain completeness have a certain valuealso
nothing was given me of which i have not rendered some account
it appears from the above estimate that my food alone cost me in moneyabout twenty-seven cents a week
it was for nearly two years afterthis rye and indian meal without yeast potatoes rice a very littlesalt pork molasses and salt and my drink water
it was fit that ishould live on rice mainly who loved so well the philosophy of india
to meet the objections of some inveterate cavillers i may as wellstate that if i dined out occasionally as i always had done and itrust shall have opportunities to do again it was frequently to thedetriment of my domestic arrangements
but the dining out being as ihave stated a constant element does not in the least affect acomparative statement like this
i learned from my two years’ experience that it would cost incrediblylittle trouble to obtain one’s necessary food even in this latitudethat a man may use as simple a diet as the animals and yet retainhealth and strength
i have made a satisfactory dinner satisfactory onseveral accounts simply off a dish of purslane (_portulaca oleracea_)which i gathered in my cornfield boiled and salted
i give the latinon account of the savoriness of the trivial name
and pray what morecan a reasonable man desire in peaceful times in ordinary noons thana sufficient number of ears of green sweet-corn boiled with theaddition of salt
even the little variety which i used was a yieldingto the demands of appetite and not of health
yet men have come tosuch a pass that they frequently starve not for want of necessariesbut for want of luxuries and i know a good woman who thinks that herson lost his life because he took to drinking water only
the reader will perceive that i am treating the subject rather from aneconomic than a dietetic point of view and he will not venture to putmy abstemiousness to the test unless he has a well-stocked larder
bread i at first made of pure indian meal and salt genuine hoe-cakeswhich i baked before my fire out of doors on a shingle or the end of astick of timber sawed off in building my house but it was wont to getsmoked and to have a piny flavor
i tried flour also but have at lastfound a mixture of rye and indian meal most convenient and agreeable
in cold weather it was no little amusement to bake several small loavesof this in succession tending and turning them as carefully as anegyptian his hatching eggs
they were a real cereal fruit which iripened and they had to my senses a fragrance like that of other noblefruits which i kept in as long as possible by wrapping them in cloths
i made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of bread-makingconsulting such authorities as offered going back to the primitivedays and first invention of the unleavened kind when from the wildnessof nuts and meats men first reached the mildness and refinement of thisdiet and travelling gradually down in my studies through thataccidental souring of the dough which it is supposed taught theleavening process and through the various fermentations thereaftertill i came to “good sweet wholesome bread” the staff of life
leaven which some deem the soul of bread the _spiritus_ which fillsits cellular tissue which is religiously preserved like the vestalfire—some precious bottle-full i suppose first brought over in themayflower did the business for america and its influence is stillrising swelling spreading in cerealian billows over the land—thisseed i regularly and faithfully procured from the village till atlength one morning i forgot the rules and scalded my yeast by whichaccident i discovered that even this was not indispensable—for mydiscoveries were not by the synthetic but analytic process—and i havegladly omitted it since though most housewives earnestly assured methat safe and wholesome bread without yeast might not be and elderlypeople prophesied a speedy decay of the vital forces
yet i find it notto be an essential ingredient and after going without it for a year amstill in the land of the living and i am glad to escape thetrivialness of carrying a bottle-full in my pocket which wouldsometimes pop and discharge its contents to my discomfiture
it issimpler and more respectable to omit it
man is an animal who more thanany other can adapt himself to all climates and circumstances
neitherdid i put any sal soda or other acid or alkali into my bread
itwould seem that i made it according to the recipe which marcus porciuscato gave about two centuries before christ
“panem depsticium sicfacito
manus mortariumque bene lavato
farinam in mortarium inditoaquæ paulatim addito subigitoque pulchre
ubi bene subegerisdefingito coquitoque sub testu
” which i take to mean—“make kneadedbread thus
wash your hands and trough well
put the meal into thetrough add water gradually and knead it thoroughly
when you havekneaded it well mould it and bake it under a cover” that is in abaking-kettle
not a word about leaven
but i did not always use thisstaff of life
at one time owing to the emptiness of my purse i sawnone of it for more than a month
every new englander might easily raise all his own breadstuffs in thisland of rye and indian corn and not depend on distant and fluctuatingmarkets for them
yet so far are we from simplicity and independencethat in concord fresh and sweet meal is rarely sold in the shops andhominy and corn in a still coarser form are hardly used by any
for themost part the farmer gives to his cattle and hogs the grain of his ownproducing and buys flour which is at least no more wholesome at agreater cost at the store
i saw that i could easily raise my bushelor two of rye and indian corn for the former will grow on the poorestland and the latter does not require the best and grind them in ahand-mill and so do without rice and pork and if i must have someconcentrated sweet i found by experiment that i could make a very goodmolasses either of pumpkins or beets and i knew that i needed only toset out a few maples to obtain it more easily still and while thesewere growing i could use various substitutes beside those which i havenamed
“for” as the forefathers sang—     “we can make liquor to sweeten our lips     of pumpkins and parsnips and walnut-tree chips
”finally as for salt that grossest of groceries to obtain this mightbe a fit occasion for a visit to the seashore or if i did without italtogether i should probably drink the less water
i do not learn thatthe indians ever troubled themselves to go after it
thus i could avoid all trade and barter so far as my food wasconcerned and having a shelter already it would only remain to getclothing and fuel
the pantaloons which i now wear were woven in afarmer’s family—thank heaven there is so much virtue still in man fori think the fall from the farmer to the operative as great andmemorable as that from the man to the farmer—and in a new countryfuel is an encumbrance
as for a habitat if i were not permitted stillto squat i might purchase one acre at the same price for which theland i cultivated was sold—namely eight dollars and eight cents
butas it was i considered that i enhanced the value of the land bysquatting on it
there is a certain class of unbelievers who sometimes ask me suchquestions as if i think that i can live on vegetable food alone andto strike at the root of the matter at once—for the root is faith—iam accustomed to answer such that i can live on board nails
if theycannot understand that they cannot understand much that i have to say
for my part i am glad to hear of experiments of this kind being triedas that a young man tried for a fortnight to live on hard raw corn onthe ear using his teeth for all mortar
the squirrel tribe tried thesame and succeeded
the human race is interested in these experimentsthough a few old women who are incapacitated for them or who own theirthirds in mills may be alarmed
my furniture part of which i made myself and the rest cost me nothingof which i have not rendered an account consisted of a bed a table adesk three chairs a looking-glass three inches in diameter a pair oftongs and andirons a kettle a skillet and a frying-pan a dipper awash-bowl two knives and forks three plates one cup one spoon ajug for oil a jug for molasses and a japanned lamp
none is so poorthat he need sit on a pumpkin
that is shiftlessness
there is a plentyof such chairs as i like best in the village garrets to be had fortaking them away
furniture
thank god i can sit and i can standwithout the aid of a furniture warehouse
what man but a philosopherwould not be ashamed to see his furniture packed in a cart and going upcountry exposed to the light of heaven and the eyes of men a beggarlyaccount of empty boxes
that is spaulding’s furniture
i could nevertell from inspecting such a load whether it belonged to a so calledrich man or a poor one the owner always seemed poverty-stricken
indeed the more you have of such things the poorer you are
each loadlooks as if it contained the contents of a dozen shanties and if oneshanty is poor this is a dozen times as poor
pray for what do we_move_ ever but to get rid of our furniture our _exuviæ_ at last togo from this world to another newly furnished and leave this to beburned
it is the same as if all these traps were buckled to a man’sbelt and he could not move over the rough country where our lines arecast without dragging them—dragging his trap
he was a lucky fox thatleft his tail in the trap
the muskrat will gnaw his third leg off tobe free
no wonder man has lost his elasticity
how often he is at adead set
“sir if i may be so bold what do you mean by a dead set
”if you are a seer whenever you meet a man you will see all that heowns ay and much that he pretends to disown behind him even to hiskitchen furniture and all the trumpery which he saves and will notburn and he will appear to be harnessed to it and making what headwayhe can
i think that the man is at a dead set who has got through aknot hole or gateway where his sledge load of furniture cannot followhim
i cannot but feel compassion when i hear some trigcompact-looking man seemingly free all girded and ready speak of his“furniture” as whether it is insured or not
“but what shall i do withmy furniture
” my gay butterfly is entangled in a spider’s web then
even those who seem for a long while not to have any if you inquiremore narrowly you will find have some stored in somebody’s barn
i lookupon england to-day as an old gentleman who is travelling with a greatdeal of baggage trumpery which has accumulated from long housekeepingwhich he has not the courage to burn great trunk little trunkbandbox and bundle
throw away the first three at least
it wouldsurpass the powers of a well man nowadays to take up his bed and walkand i should certainly advise a sick one to lay down his bed and run
when i have met an immigrant tottering under a bundle which containedhis all—looking like an enormous wen which had grown out of the nape ofhis neck—i have pitied him not because that was his all but becausehe had all _that_ to carry
if i have got to drag my trap i will takecare that it be a light one and do not nip me in a vital part
butperchance it would be wisest never to put one’s paw into it
i would observe by the way that it costs me nothing for curtains fori have no gazers to shut out but the sun and moon and i am willingthat they should look in
the moon will not sour milk nor taint meat ofmine nor will the sun injure my furniture or fade my carpet and if heis sometimes too warm a friend i find it still better economy toretreat behind some curtain which nature has provided than to add asingle item to the details of housekeeping
a lady once offered me amat but as i had no room to spare within the house nor time to sparewithin or without to shake it i declined it preferring to wipe myfeet on the sod before my door
it is best to avoid the beginnings ofevil
not long since i was present at the auction of a deacon’s effects forhis life had not been ineffectual—     “the evil that men do lives after them
”as usual a great proportion was trumpery which had begun to accumulatein his father’s day
among the rest was a dried tapeworm
and nowafter lying half a century in his garret and other dust holes thesethings were not burned instead of a _bonfire_ or purifyingdestruction of them there was an _auction_ or increasing of them
theneighbors eagerly collected to view them bought them all andcarefully transported them to their garrets and dust holes to liethere till their estates are settled when they will start again
whena man dies he kicks the dust
the customs of some savage nations might perchance be profitablyimitated by us for they at least go through the semblance of castingtheir slough annually they have the idea of the thing whether theyhave the reality or not
would it not be well if we were to celebratesuch a “busk” or “feast of first fruits” as bartram describes to havebeen the custom of the mucclasse indians
“when a town celebrates thebusk” says he “having previously provided themselves with newclothes new pots pans and other household utensils and furniturethey collect all their worn out clothes and other despicable thingssweep and cleanse their houses squares and the whole town of theirfilth which with all the remaining grain and other old provisions theycast together into one common heap and consume it with fire
afterhaving taken medicine and fasted for three days all the fire in thetown is extinguished
during this fast they abstain from thegratification of every appetite and passion whatever
a general amnestyis proclaimed all malefactors may return to their town
—”“on the fourth morning the high priest by rubbing dry wood togetherproduces new fire in the public square from whence every habitation inthe town is supplied with the new and pure flame
”they then feast on the new corn and fruits and dance and sing forthree days “and the four following days they receive visits andrejoice with their friends from neighboring towns who have in likemanner purified and prepared themselves
”the mexicans also practised a similar purification at the end of everyfifty-two years in the belief that it was time for the world to cometo an end
i have scarcely heard of a truer sacrament that is as the dictionarydefines it “outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritualgrace” than this and i have no doubt that they were originallyinspired directly from heaven to do thus though they have no biblicalrecord of the revelation
for more than five years i maintained myself thus solely by the laborof my hands and i found that by working about six weeks in a year icould meet all the expenses of living
the whole of my winters as wellas most of my summers i had free and clear for study
i havethoroughly tried school-keeping and found that my expenses were inproportion or rather out of proportion to my income for i wasobliged to dress and train not to say think and believe accordinglyand i lost my time into the bargain
as i did not teach for the good ofmy fellow-men but simply for a livelihood this was a failure
i havetried trade but i found that it would take ten years to get under wayin that and that then i should probably be on my way to the devil
iwas actually afraid that i might by that time be doing what is called agood business
when formerly i was looking about to see what i could dofor a living some sad experience in conforming to the wishes offriends being fresh in my mind to tax my ingenuity i thought often andseriously of picking huckleberries that surely i could do and itssmall profits might suffice—for my greatest skill has been to want butlittle—so little capital it required so little distraction from mywonted moods i foolishly thought
while my acquaintances wentunhesitatingly into trade or the professions i contemplated thisoccupation as most like theirs ranging the hills all summer to pickthe berries which came in my way and thereafter carelessly dispose ofthem so to keep the flocks of admetus
i also dreamed that i mightgather the wild herbs or carry evergreens to such villagers as lovedto be reminded of the woods even to the city by hay-cart loads
but ihave since learned that trade curses everything it handles and thoughyou trade in messages from heaven the whole curse of trade attaches tothe business
as i preferred some things to others and especially valued my freedomas i could fare hard and yet succeed well i did not wish to spend mytime in earning rich carpets or other fine furniture or delicatecookery or a house in the grecian or the gothic style just yet
ifthere are any to whom it is no interruption to acquire these thingsand who know how to use them when acquired i relinquish to them thepursuit
some are “industrious” and appear to love labor for its ownsake or perhaps because it keeps them out of worse mischief to such ihave at present nothing to say
those who would not know what to dowith more leisure than they now enjoy i might advise to work twice ashard as they do—work till they pay for themselves and get their freepapers
for myself i found that the occupation of a day-laborer was themost independent of any especially as it required only thirty or fortydays in a year to support one
the laborer’s day ends with the goingdown of the sun and he is then free to devote himself to his chosenpursuit independent of his labor but his employer who speculatesfrom month to month has no respite from one end of the year to theother
in short i am convinced both by faith and experience that tomaintain one’s self on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime ifwe will live simply and wisely as the pursuits of the simpler nationsare still the sports of the more artificial
it is not necessary that aman should earn his living by the sweat of his brow unless he sweatseasier than i do
one young man of my acquaintance who has inherited some acres told methat he thought he should live as i did _if he had the means_
i wouldnot have any one adopt _my_ mode of living on any account for besidethat before he has fairly learned it i may have found out another formyself i desire that there may be as many different persons in theworld as possible but i would have each one be very careful to findout and pursue _his own_ way and not his father’s or his mother’s orhis neighbor’s instead
the youth may build or plant or sail only lethim not be hindered from doing that which he tells me he would like todo
it is by a mathematical point only that we are wise as the sailoror the fugitive slave keeps the polestar in his eye but that issufficient guidance for all our life
we may not arrive at our portwithin a calculable period but we would preserve the true course
undoubtedly in this case what is true for one is truer still for athousand as a large house is not proportionally more expensive than asmall one since one roof may cover one cellar underlie and one wallseparate several apartments
but for my part i preferred the solitarydwelling
moreover it will commonly be cheaper to build the wholeyourself than to convince another of the advantage of the common walland when you have done this the common partition to be much cheapermust be a thin one and that other may prove a bad neighbor and alsonot keep his side in repair
the only coöperation which is commonlypossible is exceedingly partial and superficial and what little truecoöperation there is is as if it were not being a harmony inaudibleto men
if a man has faith he will coöperate with equal faitheverywhere if he has not faith he will continue to live like the restof the world whatever company he is joined to
to coöperate in thehighest as well as the lowest sense means _to get our livingtogether_
i heard it proposed lately that two young men should traveltogether over the world the one without money earning his means as hewent before the mast and behind the plow the other carrying a bill ofexchange in his pocket
it was easy to see that they could not long becompanions or coöperate since one would not _operate_ at all
theywould part at the first interesting crisis in their adventures
aboveall as i have implied the man who goes alone can start to-day but hewho travels with another must wait till that other is ready and it maybe a long time before they get off
but all this is very selfish i have heard some of my townsmen say
iconfess that i have hitherto indulged very little in philanthropicenterprises
i have made some sacrifices to a sense of duty and amongothers have sacrificed this pleasure also
there are those who haveused all their arts to persuade me to undertake the support of somepoor family in the town and if i had nothing to do—for the devilfinds employment for the idle—i might try my hand at some such pastimeas that
however when i have thought to indulge myself in thisrespect and lay their heaven under an obligation by maintainingcertain poor persons in all respects as comfortably as i maintainmyself and have even ventured so far as to make them the offer theyhave one and all unhesitatingly preferred to remain poor
while mytownsmen and women are devoted in so many ways to the good of theirfellows i trust that one at least may be spared to other and lesshumane pursuits
you must have a genius for charity as well as for anything else
as for doing-good that is one of the professions which arefull
moreover i have tried it fairly and strange as it may seem amsatisfied that it does not agree with my constitution
probably ishould not consciously and deliberately forsake my particular callingto do the good which society demands of me to save the universe fromannihilation and i believe that a like but infinitely greatersteadfastness elsewhere is all that now preserves it
but i would notstand between any man and his genius and to him who does this workwhich i decline with his whole heart and soul and life i would saypersevere even if the world call it doing evil as it is most likelythey will
i am far from supposing that my case is a peculiar one no doubt manyof my readers would make a similar defence
at doing something—i willnot engage that my neighbors shall pronounce it good—i do not hesitateto say that i should be a capital fellow to hire but what that is itis for my employer to find out
what _good_ i do in the common senseof that word must be aside from my main path and for the most partwholly unintended
men say practically begin where you are and suchas you are without aiming mainly to become of more worth and withkindness aforethought go about doing good
if i were to preach at allin this strain i should say rather set about being good
as if thesun should stop when he had kindled his fires up to the splendor of amoon or a star of the sixth magnitude and go about like a robingoodfellow peeping in at every cottage window inspiring lunatics andtainting meats and making darkness visible instead of steadilyincreasing his genial heat and beneficence till he is of suchbrightness that no mortal can look him in the face and then and inthe mean while too going about the world in his own orbit doing itgood or rather as a truer philosophy has discovered the world goingabout him getting good
when phaeton wishing to prove his heavenlybirth by his beneficence had the sun’s chariot but one day and droveout of the beaten track he burned several blocks of houses in thelower streets of heaven and scorched the surface of the earth anddried up every spring and made the great desert of sahara till atlength jupiter hurled him headlong to the earth with a thunderbolt andthe sun through grief at his death did not shine for a year
there is no odor so bad as that which arises from goodness tainted
itis human it is divine carrion
if i knew for a certainty that a manwas coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good ishould run for my life as from that dry and parching wind of theafrican deserts called the simoom which fills the mouth and nose andears and eyes with dust till you are suffocated for fear that i shouldget some of his good done to me—some of its virus mingled with myblood
no—in this case i would rather suffer evil the natural way
aman is not a good _man_ to me because he will feed me if i should bestarving or warm me if i should be freezing or pull me out of a ditchif i should ever fall into one
i can find you a newfoundland dog thatwill do as much
philanthropy is not love for one’s fellow-man in thebroadest sense
howard was no doubt an exceedingly kind and worthy manin his way and has his reward but comparatively speaking what are ahundred howards to _us_ if their philanthropy do not help _us_ in ourbest estate when we are most worthy to be helped

be sure that you give the poor the aid they most need though it beyour example which leaves them far behind
if you give money spendyourself with it and do not merely abandon it to them
we make curiousmistakes sometimes
often the poor man is not so cold and hungry as heis dirty and ragged and gross
it is partly his taste and not merelyhis misfortune
if you give him money he will perhaps buy more ragswith it
i was wont to pity the clumsy irish laborers who cut ice onthe pond in such mean and ragged clothes while i shivered in my moretidy and somewhat more fashionable garments till one bitter cold dayone who had slipped into the water came to my house to warm him and isaw him strip off three pairs of pants and two pairs of stockings erehe got down to the skin though they were dirty and ragged enough itis true and that he could afford to refuse the _extra_ garments whichi offered him he had so many _intra_ ones
this ducking was the verything he needed
then i began to pity myself and i saw that it wouldbe a greater charity to bestow on me a flannel shirt than a wholeslop-shop on him
there are a thousand hacking at the branches of evilto one who is striking at the root and it may be that he who bestowsthe largest amount of time and money on the needy is doing the most byhis mode of life to produce that misery which he strives in vain torelieve
it is the pious slave-breeder devoting the proceeds of everytenth slave to buy a sunday’s liberty for the rest
some show theirkindness to the poor by employing them in their kitchens
would theynot be kinder if they employed themselves there
you boast of spendinga tenth part of your income in charity maybe you should spend the ninetenths so and done with it
society recovers only a tenth part of theproperty then
is this owing to the generosity of him in whosepossession it is found or to the remissness of the officers ofjustice
philanthropy is almost the only virtue which is sufficientlyappreciated by mankind
nay it is greatly overrated and it is ourselfishness which overrates it
a robust poor man one sunny day herein concord praised a fellow-townsman to me because as he said hewas kind to the poor meaning himself
the kind uncles and aunts of therace are more esteemed than its true spiritual fathers and mothers

they were penn howard and mrs

every onemust feel the falsehood and cant of this
the last were not england’sbest men and women only perhaps her best philanthropists
i would not subtract any thing from the praise that is due tophilanthropy but merely demand justice for all who by their lives andworks are a blessing to mankind
i do not value chiefly a man’suprightness and benevolence which are as it were his stem andleaves
those plants of whose greenness withered we make herb tea forthe sick serve but a humble use and are most employed by quacks
iwant the flower and fruit of a man that some fragrance be wafted overfrom him to me and some ripeness flavor our intercourse

being a microcosm himself he discovers and it is a true discoveryand he is the man to make it—that the world has been eating greenapples to his eyes in fact the globe itself is a great green applewhich there is danger awful to think of that the children of men willnibble before it is ripe and straightway his drastic philanthropyseeks out the esquimaux and the patagonian and embraces the populousindian and chinese villages and thus by a few years of philanthropicactivity the powers in the mean while using him for their own ends nodoubt he cures himself of his dyspepsia the globe acquires a faintblush on one or both of its cheeks as if it were beginning to be ripeand life loses its crudity and is once more sweet and wholesome tolive
i never dreamed of any enormity greater than i have committed

i believe that what so saddens the reformer is not his sympathy withhis fellows in distress but though he be the holiest son of god ishis private ail

i read in the gulistan or flower garden of sheik sadi of shiraz that“they asked a wise man saying of the many celebrated trees which themost high god has created lofty and umbrageous they call none azad orfree excepting the cypress which bears no fruit what mystery isthere in this
he replied each has its appropriate produce andappointed season during the continuance of which it is fresh andblooming and during their absence dry and withered to neither ofwhich states is the cypress exposed being always flourishing and ofthis nature are the azads or religious independents

carewwhere i lived and what i lived forat a certain season of our life we are accustomed to consider everyspot as the possible site of a house
i have thus surveyed the countryon every side within a dozen miles of where i live
in imagination ihave bought all the farms in succession for all were to be bought andi knew their price
i walked over each farmer’s premises tasted hiswild apples discoursed on husbandry with him took his farm at hisprice at any price mortgaging it to him in my mind even put a higherprice on it—took everything but a deed of it—took his word for hisdeed for i dearly love to talk—cultivated it and him too to someextent i trust and withdrew when i had enjoyed it long enoughleaving him to carry it on
this experience entitled me to be regardedas a sort of real-estate broker by my friends
wherever i sat there imight live and the landscape radiated from me accordingly
what is ahouse but a _sedes_ a seat
—better if a country seat
i discoveredmany a site for a house not likely to be soon improved which somemight have thought too far from the village but to my eyes the villagewas too far from it
well there i might live i said and there i didlive for an hour a summer and a winter life saw how i could let theyears run off buffet the winter through and see the spring come in
the future inhabitants of this region wherever they may place theirhouses may be sure that they have been anticipated
an afternoonsufficed to lay out the land into orchard woodlot and pasture and todecide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the doorand whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage andthen i let it lie fallow perchance for a man is rich in proportion tothe number of things which he can afford to let alone
my imagination carried me so far that i even had the refusal of severalfarms—the refusal was all i wanted—but i never got my fingers burnedby actual possession
the nearest that i came to actual possession waswhen i bought the hollowell place and had begun to sort my seeds andcollected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on oroff with but before the owner gave me a deed of it his wife—every manhas such a wife—changed her mind and wished to keep it and he offeredme ten dollars to release him
now to speak the truth i had but tencents in the world and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell if i wasthat man who had ten cents or who had a farm or ten dollars or alltogether
however i let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too fori had carried it far enough or rather to be generous i sold him thefarm for just what i gave for it and as he was not a rich man madehim a present of ten dollars and still had my ten cents and seedsand materials for a wheelbarrow left
i found thus that i had been arich man without any damage to my poverty
but i retained thelandscape and i have since annually carried off what it yieldedwithout a wheelbarrow
with respect to landscapes—     “i am monarch of all i _survey_     my right there is none to dispute
”i have frequently seen a poet withdraw having enjoyed the mostvaluable part of a farm while the crusty farmer supposed that he hadgot a few wild apples only
why the owner does not know it for manyyears when a poet has put his farm in rhyme the most admirable kind ofinvisible fence has fairly impounded it milked it skimmed it andgot all the cream and left the farmer only the skimmed milk
the real attractions of the hollowell farm to me were its completeretirement being about two miles from the village half a mile fromthe nearest neighbor and separated from the highway by a broad fieldits bounding on the river which the owner said protected it by itsfogs from frosts in the spring though that was nothing to me the graycolor and ruinous state of the house and barn and the dilapidatedfences which put such an interval between me and the last occupantthe hollow and lichen-covered apple trees gnawed by rabbits showingwhat kind of neighbors i should have but above all the recollection ihad of it from my earliest voyages up the river when the house wasconcealed behind a dense grove of red maples through which i heard thehouse-dog bark
i was in haste to buy it before the proprietorfinished getting out some rocks cutting down the hollow apple treesand grubbing up some young birches which had sprung up in the pastureor in short had made any more of his improvements
to enjoy theseadvantages i was ready to carry it on like atlas to take the world onmy shoulders—i never heard what compensation he received for that—anddo all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that imight pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it for i knewall the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind iwanted if i could only afford to let it alone
but it turned out as ihave said
all that i could say then with respect to farming on a large scale(i have always cultivated a garden) was that i had had my seedsready
many think that seeds improve with age
i have no doubt thattime discriminates between the good and the bad and when at last ishall plant i shall be less likely to be disappointed
but i would sayto my fellows once for all as long as possible live free anduncommitted
it makes but little difference whether you are committedto a farm or the county jail
old cato whose “de re rusticâ” is my “cultivator” says and the onlytranslation i have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage “when youthink of getting a farm turn it thus in your mind not to buygreedily nor spare your pains to look at it and do not think itenough to go round it once
the oftener you go there the more it willplease you if it is good
” i think i shall not buy greedily but goround and round it as long as i live and be buried in it first thatit may please me the more at last
the present was my next experiment of this kind which i purpose todescribe more at length for convenience putting the experience of twoyears into one
as i have said i do not propose to write an ode todejection but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morningstanding on his roost if only to wake my neighbors up
when first i took up my abode in the woods that is began to spend mynights as well as days there which by accident was on independenceday or the fourth of july 1845 my house was not finished for winterbut was merely a defence against the rain without plastering orchimney the walls being of rough weather-stained boards with widechinks which made it cool at night
the upright white hewn studs andfreshly planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy lookespecially in the morning when its timbers were saturated with dew sothat i fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them
to myimagination it retained throughout the day more or less of this auroralcharacter reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which i hadvisited the year before
this was an airy and unplastered cabin fit toentertain a travelling god and where a goddess might trail hergarments
the winds which passed over my dwelling were such as sweepover the ridges of mountains bearing the broken strains or celestialparts only of terrestrial music
the morning wind forever blows thepoem of creation is uninterrupted but few are the ears that hear it
olympus is but the outside of the earth every where
the only house i had been the owner of before if i except a boat wasa tent which i used occasionally when making excursions in the summerand this is still rolled up in my garret but the boat after passingfrom hand to hand has gone down the stream of time
with this moresubstantial shelter about me i had made some progress toward settlingin the world
this frame so slightly clad was a sort ofcrystallization around me and reacted on the builder
it wassuggestive somewhat as a picture in outlines
i did not need to gooutdoors to take the air for the atmosphere within had lost none ofits freshness
it was not so much within doors as behind a door where isat even in the rainiest weather
the harivansa says “an abodewithout birds is like a meat without seasoning
” such was not my abodefor i found myself suddenly neighbor to the birds not by havingimprisoned one but having caged myself near them
i was not onlynearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and theorchard but to those wilder and more thrilling songsters of the forestwhich never or rarely serenade a villager—the wood-thrush theveery the scarlet tanager the field-sparrow the whippoorwill andmany others
i was seated by the shore of a small pond about a mile and a halfsouth of the village of concord and somewhat higher than it in themidst of an extensive wood between that town and lincoln and about twomiles south of that our only field known to fame concord battleground but i was so low in the woods that the opposite shore half amile off like the rest covered with wood was my most distanthorizon
for the first week whenever i looked out on the pond itimpressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain its bottomfar above the surface of other lakes and as the sun arose i saw itthrowing off its nightly clothing of mist and here and there bydegrees its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface wasrevealed while the mists like ghosts were stealthily withdrawing inevery direction into the woods as at the breaking up of some nocturnalconventicle
the very dew seemed to hang upon the trees later into theday than usual as on the sides of mountains
this small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of agentle rain storm in august when both air and water being perfectlystill but the sky overcast mid-afternoon had all the serenity ofevening and the wood-thrush sang around and was heard from shore toshore
a lake like this is never smoother than at such a time and theclear portion of the air above it being shallow and darkened by cloudsthe water full of light and reflections becomes a lower heaven itselfso much the more important
from a hill top near by where the wood hadbeen recently cut off there was a pleasing vista southward across thepond through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shorethere where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested astream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley butstream there was none
that way i looked between and over the neargreen hills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon tinged withblue
indeed by standing on tiptoe i could catch a glimpse of some ofthe peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in thenorth-west those true-blue coins from heaven’s own mint and also ofsome portion of the village
but in other directions even from thispoint i could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me
itis well to have some water in your neighborhood to give buoyancy toand float the earth
one value even of the smallest well is that whenyou look into it you see that earth is not continent but insular
thisis as important as that it keeps butter cool
when i looked across thepond from this peak toward the sudbury meadows which in time of floodi distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valleylike a coin in a basin all the earth beyond the pond appeared like athin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet ofinterverting water and i was reminded that this on which i dwelt wasbut _dry land_
though the view from my door was still more contracted i did not feelcrowded or confined in the least
there was pasture enough for myimagination
the low shrub-oak plateau to which the opposite shorearose stretched away toward the prairies of the west and the steppesof tartary affording ample room for all the roving families of men
“there are none happy in the world but beings who enjoy freely a vasthorizon”—said damodara when his herds required new and largerpastures
both place and time were changed and i dwelt nearer to those parts ofthe universe and to those eras in history which had most attracted me
where i lived was as far off as many a region viewed nightly byastronomers
we are wont to imagine rare and delectable places in someremote and more celestial corner of the system behind theconstellation of cassiopeia’s chair far from noise and disturbance
idiscovered that my house actually had its site in such a withdrawn butforever new and unprofaned part of the universe
if it were worth thewhile to settle in those parts near to the pleiades or the hyades toaldebaran or altair then i was really there or at an equal remotenessfrom the life which i had left behind dwindled and twinkling with asfine a ray to my nearest neighbor and to be seen only in moonlessnights by him
such was that part of creation where i had squatted—     “there was a shepherd that did live         and held his thoughts as high     as were the mounts whereon his flocks         did hourly feed him by
”what should we think of the shepherd’s life if his flocks alwayswandered to higher pastures than his thoughts
every morning was a cheerful invitation to make my life of equalsimplicity and i may say innocence with nature herself
i have beenas sincere a worshipper of aurora as the greeks
i got up early andbathed in the pond that was a religious exercise and one of the bestthings which i did
they say that characters were engraven on thebathing tub of king tching-thang to this effect “renew thyselfcompletely each day do it again and again and forever again
” i canunderstand that
morning brings back the heroic ages
i was as muchaffected by the faint hum of a mosquito making its invisible andunimaginable tour through my apartment at earliest dawn when i wassitting with door and windows open as i could be by any trumpet thatever sang of fame
it was homer’s requiem itself an iliad and odysseyin the air singing its own wrath and wanderings
there was somethingcosmical about it a standing advertisement till forbidden of theeverlasting vigor and fertility of the world
the morning which is themost memorable season of the day is the awakening hour
then there isleast somnolence in us and for an hour at least some part of usawakes which slumbers all the rest of the day and night
little is tobe expected of that day if it can be called a day to which we are notawakened by our genius but by the mechanical nudgings of someservitor are not awakened by our own newly-acquired force andaspirations from within accompanied by the undulations of celestialmusic instead of factory bells and a fragrance filling the air—to ahigher life than we fell asleep from and thus the darkness bear itsfruit and prove itself to be good no less than the light
that manwho does not believe that each day contains an earlier more sacredand auroral hour than he has yet profaned has despaired of life andis pursuing a descending and darkening way
after a partial cessationof his sensuous life the soul of man or its organs rather arereinvigorated each day and his genius tries again what noble life itcan make
all memorable events i should say transpire in morning timeand in a morning atmosphere
the vedas say “all intelligences awakewith the morning
” poetry and art and the fairest and most memorableof the actions of men date from such an hour
all poets and heroeslike memnon are the children of aurora and emit their music atsunrise
to him whose elastic and vigorous thought keeps pace with thesun the day is a perpetual morning
it matters not what the clocks sayor the attitudes and labors of men
morning is when i am awake andthere is a dawn in me
moral reform is the effort to throw off sleep
why is it that men give so poor an account of their day if they havenot been slumbering
they are not such poor calculators
if they hadnot been overcome with drowsiness they would have performed something
the millions are awake enough for physical labor but only one in amillion is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion only onein a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life
to be awake is to bealive
i have never yet met a man who was quite awake
how could i havelooked him in the face
we must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake not by mechanicalaids but by an infinite expectation of the dawn which does notforsake us in our soundest sleep
i know of no more encouraging factthan the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by aconscious endeavor
it is something to be able to paint a particularpicture or to carve a statue and so to make a few objects beautifulbut it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere andmedium through which we look which morally we can do
to affect thequality of the day that is the highest of arts
every man is tasked tomake his life even in its details worthy of the contemplation of hismost elevated and critical hour
if we refused or rather used up suchpaltry information as we get the oracles would distinctly inform ushow this might be done
i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to frontonly the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what ithad to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had notlived
i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nordid i wish to practise resignation unless it was quite necessary
iwanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live sosturdily and spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life tocut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a corner andreduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean why thento get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meannessto the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and beable to give a true account of it in my next excursion
for most menit appears to me are in a strange uncertainty about it whether it isof the devil or of god and have _somewhat hastily_ concluded that itis the chief end of man here to “glorify god and enjoy him forever
”still we live meanly like ants though the fable tells us that we werelong ago changed into men like pygmies we fight with cranes it iserror upon error and clout upon clout and our best virtue has for itsoccasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness
our life is fritteredaway by detail
an honest man has hardly need to count more than histen fingers or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes and lump therest
simplicity simplicity simplicity
i say let your affairs be astwo or three and not a hundred or a thousand instead of a millioncount half a dozen and keep your accounts on your thumb nail
in themidst of this chopping sea of civilized life such are the clouds andstorms and quicksands and thousand-and-one items to be allowed forthat a man has to live if he would not founder and go to the bottomand not make his port at all by dead reckoning and he must be a greatcalculator indeed who succeeds

instead of threemeals a day if it be necessary eat but one instead of a hundreddishes five and reduce other things in proportion
our life is like agerman confederacy made up of petty states with its boundary foreverfluctuating so that even a german cannot tell you how it is bounded atany moment
the nation itself with all its so called internalimprovements which by the way are all external and superficial isjust such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment cluttered withfurniture and tripped up by its own traps ruined by luxury andheedless expense by want of calculation and a worthy aim as themillion households in the land and the only cure for it as for them isin a rigid economy a stern and more than spartan simplicity of lifeand elevation of purpose
it lives too fast
men think that it isessential that the _nation_ have commerce and export ice and talkthrough a telegraph and ride thirty miles an hour without a doubtwhether _they_ do or not but whether we should live like baboons orlike men is a little uncertain
if we do not get out sleepers andforge rails and devote days and nights to the work but go totinkering upon our _lives_ to improve _them_ who will build railroads
and if railroads are not built how shall we get to heaven in season
but if we stay at home and mind our business who will want railroads
we do not ride on the railroad it rides upon us
did you ever thinkwhat those sleepers are that underlie the railroad
each one is a manan irish-man or a yankee man
the rails are laid on them and they arecovered with sand and the cars run smoothly over them
they are soundsleepers i assure you
and every few years a new lot is laid down andrun over so that if some have the pleasure of riding on a railothers have the misfortune to be ridden upon
and when they run over aman that is walking in his sleep a supernumerary sleeper in the wrongposition and wake him up they suddenly stop the cars and make a hueand cry about it as if this were an exception
i am glad to know thatit takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers downand level in their beds as it is for this is a sign that they maysometime get up again
why should we live with such hurry and waste of life
we are determinedto be starved before we are hungry
men say that a stitch in time savesnine and so they take a thousand stitches to-day to save nineto-morrow
as for _work_ we haven’t any of any consequence
we havethe saint vitus’ dance and cannot possibly keep our heads still
if ishould only give a few pulls at the parish bell-rope as for a firethat is without setting the bell there is hardly a man on his farm inthe outskirts of concord notwithstanding that press of engagementswhich was his excuse so many times this morning nor a boy nor awoman i might almost say but would forsake all and follow that soundnot mainly to save property from the flames but if we will confessthe truth much more to see it burn since burn it must and we be itknown did not set it on fire—or to see it put out and have a hand init if that is done as handsomely yes even if it were the parishchurch itself
hardly a man takes a half hour’s nap after dinner butwhen he wakes he holds up his head and asks “what’s the news
” as ifthe rest of mankind had stood his sentinels
some give directions to bewaked every half hour doubtless for no other purpose and then to payfor it they tell what they have dreamed
after a night’s sleep thenews is as indispensable as the breakfast
“pray tell me any thing newthat has happened to a man any where on this globe”—and he reads itover his coffee and rolls that a man has had his eyes gouged out thismorning on the wachito river never dreaming the while that he lives inthe dark unfathomed mammoth cave of this world and has but therudiment of an eye himself
for my part i could easily do without the post-office
i think thatthere are very few important communications made through it
to speakcritically i never received more than one or two letters in my life—iwrote this some years ago—that were worth the postage
the penny-postis commonly an institution through which you seriously offer a manthat penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in jest
and i am sure that i never read any memorable news in a newspaper
ifwe read of one man robbed or murdered or killed by accident or onehouse burned or one vessel wrecked or one steamboat blown up or onecow run over on the western railroad or one mad dog killed or one lotof grasshoppers in the winter—we never need read of another
one isenough
if you are acquainted with the principle what do you care fora myriad instances and applications
to a philosopher all _news_ as itis called is gossip and they who edit and read it are old women overtheir tea
yet not a few are greedy after this gossip
there was such arush as i hear the other day at one of the offices to learn theforeign news by the last arrival that several large squares of plateglass belonging to the establishment were broken by the pressure—newswhich i seriously think a ready wit might write a twelve-month ortwelve years beforehand with sufficient accuracy
as for spain forinstance if you know how to throw in don carlos and the infanta anddon pedro and seville and granada from time to time in the rightproportions—they may have changed the names a little since i saw thepapers—and serve up a bull-fight when other entertainments fail itwill be true to the letter and give us as good an idea of the exactstate or ruin of things in spain as the most succinct and lucid reportsunder this head in the newspapers and as for england almost the lastsignificant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average yearyou never need attend to that thing again unless your speculations areof a merely pecuniary character
if one may judge who rarely looks intothe newspapers nothing new does ever happen in foreign parts a frenchrevolution not excepted
what news
how much more important to know what that is which was neverold
“kieou-he-yu (great dignitary of the state of wei) sent a man tokhoung-tseu to know his news
khoung-tseu caused the messenger to beseated near him and questioned him in these terms what is your masterdoing
the messenger answered with respect my master desires todiminish the number of his faults but he cannot come to the end ofthem
the messenger being gone the philosopher remarked what a worthymessenger

” the preacher instead of vexingthe ears of drowsy farmers on their day of rest at the end of theweek—for sunday is the fit conclusion of an ill-spent week and notthe fresh and brave beginning of a new one—with this one otherdraggle-tail of a sermon should shout with thundering voice “pause

”shams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths while reality isfabulous
if men would steadily observe realities only and not allowthemselves to be deluded life to compare it with such things as weknow would be like a fairy tale and the arabian nights’entertainments
if we respected only what is inevitable and has a rightto be music and poetry would resound along the streets
when we areunhurried and wise we perceive that only great and worthy things haveany permanent and absolute existence—that petty fears and pettypleasures are but the shadow of the reality
this is alwaysexhilarating and sublime
by closing the eyes and slumbering andconsenting to be deceived by shows men establish and confirm theirdaily life of routine and habit everywhere which still is built onpurely illusory foundations
children who play life discern its truelaw and relations more clearly than men who fail to live it worthilybut who think that they are wiser by experience that is by failure
ihave read in a hindoo book that “there was a king’s son who beingexpelled in infancy from his native city was brought up by a foresterand growing up to maturity in that state imagined himself to belongto the barbarous race with which he lived
one of his father’sministers having discovered him revealed to him what he was and themisconception of his character was removed and he knew himself to be aprince

if a man should walk through this town and see only the reality wherethink you would the “mill-dam” go to
if he should give us an accountof the realities he beheld there we should not recognize the place inhis description

men esteem truth remote in the outskirts of the system behindthe farthest star before adam and after the last man
in eternitythere is indeed something true and sublime
but all these times andplaces and occasions are now and here
god himself culminates in thepresent moment and will never be more divine in the lapse of all theages
and we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and nobleonly by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality thatsurrounds us
the universe constantly and obediently answers to ourconceptions whether we travel fast or slow the track is laid for us
let us spend our lives in conceiving then
the poet or the artist neveryet had so fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at leastcould accomplish it
let us spend one day as deliberately as nature and not be thrown offthe track by every nutshell and mosquito’s wing that falls on therails
let us rise early and fast or break fast gently and withoutperturbation let company come and let company go let the bells ringand the children cry—determined to make a day of it
why should weknock under and go with the stream
let us not be upset and overwhelmedin that terrible rapid and whirlpool called a dinner situated in themeridian shallows

my residence was more favorable not only to thought but to seriousreading than a university and though i was beyond the range of theordinary circulating library i had more than ever come within theinfluence of those books which circulate round the world whosesentences were first written on bark and are now merely copied fromtime to time on to linen paper

the student may read homer or æschylus in the greek without danger ofdissipation or luxuriousness for it implies that he in some measureemulate their heroes and consecrate morning hours to their pages
theheroic books even if printed in the character of our mother tonguewill always be in a language dead to degenerate times and we mustlaboriously seek the meaning of each word and line conjecturing alarger sense than common use permits out of what wisdom and valor andgenerosity we have
the modern cheap and fertile press with all itstranslations has done little to bring us nearer to the heroic writersof antiquity
they seem as solitary and the letter in which they areprinted as rare and curious as ever
it is worth the expense ofyouthful days and costly hours if you learn only some words of anancient language which are raised out of the trivialness of thestreet to be perpetual suggestions and provocations
it is not in vainthat the farmer remembers and repeats the few latin words which he hasheard

to read well that is toread true books in a true spirit is a noble exercise and one thatwill task the reader more than any exercise which the customs of theday esteem
it requires a training such as the athletes underwent thesteady intention almost of the whole life to this object
books must beread as deliberately and reservedly as they were written
it is notenough even to be able to speak the language of that nation by whichthey are written for there is a memorable interval between the spokenand the written language the language heard and the language read
theone is commonly transitory a sound a tongue a dialect merely almostbrutish and we learn it unconsciously like the brutes of ourmothers
the other is the maturity and experience of that if that isour mother tongue this is our father tongue a reserved and selectexpression too significant to be heard by the ear which we must beborn again in order to speak
the crowds of men who merely _spoke_ thegreek and latin tongues in the middle ages were not entitled by theaccident of birth to _read_ the works of genius written in thoselanguages for these were not written in that greek or latin which theyknew but in the select language of literature
they had not learnedthe nobler dialects of greece and rome but the very materials on whichthey were written were waste paper to them and they prized instead acheap contemporary literature
but when the several nations of europehad acquired distinct though rude written languages of their ownsufficient for the purposes of their rising literatures then firstlearning revived and scholars were enabled to discern from thatremoteness the treasures of antiquity

however much we may admire the orator’s occasional bursts of eloquencethe noblest written words are commonly as far behind or above thefleeting spoken language as the firmament with its stars is behind theclouds
_there_ are the stars and they who can may read them
theastronomers forever comment on and observe them
they are notexhalations like our daily colloquies and vaporous breath
what iscalled eloquence in the forum is commonly found to be rhetoric in thestudy

a written word is the choicest of relics
it issomething at once more intimate with us and more universal than anyother work of art

their authors are a natural and irresistible aristocracy in everysociety and more than kings or emperors exert an influence onmankind
when the illiterate and perhaps scornful trader has earned byenterprise and industry his coveted leisure and independence and isadmitted to the circles of wealth and fashion he turns inevitably atlast to those still higher but yet inaccessible circles of intellectand genius and is sensible only of the imperfection of his culture andthe vanity and insufficiency of all his riches and further proves hisgood sense by the pains which he takes to secure for his children thatintellectual culture whose want he so keenly feels and thus it is thathe becomes the founder of a family
those who have not learned to read the ancient classics in the languagein which they were written must have a very imperfect knowledge of thehistory of the human race for it is remarkable that no transcript ofthem has ever been made into any modern tongue unless our civilizationitself may be regarded as such a transcript
homer has never yet beenprinted in english nor æschylus nor virgil even—works as refined assolidly done and as beautiful almost as the morning itself for laterwriters say what we will of their genius have rarely if everequalled the elaborate beauty and finish and the lifelong and heroicliterary labors of the ancients
they only talk of forgetting them whonever knew them
it will be soon enough to forget them when we have thelearning and the genius which will enable us to attend to andappreciate them
that age will be rich indeed when those relics whichwe call classics and the still older and more than classic but evenless known scriptures of the nations shall have still furtheraccumulated when the vaticans shall be filled with vedas andzendavestas and bibles with homers and dantes and shakespeares andall the centuries to come shall have successively deposited theirtrophies in the forum of the world
by such a pile we may hope to scaleheaven at last
the works of the great poets have never yet been read by mankind foronly great poets can read them
they have only been read as themultitude read the stars at most astrologically not astronomically
most men have learned to read to serve a paltry convenience as theyhave learned to cipher in order to keep accounts and not be cheated intrade but of reading as a noble intellectual exercise they know littleor nothing yet this only is reading in a high sense not that whichlulls us as a luxury and suffers the nobler faculties to sleep thewhile but what we have to stand on tip-toe to read and devote our mostalert and wakeful hours to
i think that having learned our letters we should read the best that isin literature and not be forever repeating our a b abs and words ofone syllable in the fourth or fifth classes sitting on the lowest andforemost form all our lives

for my part i think that they had better metamorphose all suchaspiring heroes of universal noveldom into man weathercocks as theyused to put heroes among the constellations and let them swing roundthere till they are rusty and not come down at all to bother honestmen with their pranks

the best books are not read even by those who are called good readers
what does our concord culture amount to
there is in this town with avery few exceptions no taste for the best or for very good books evenin english literature whose words all can read and spell
even thecollege-bred and so called liberally educated men here and elsewherehave really little or no acquaintance with the english classics and asfor the recorded wisdom of mankind the ancient classics and bibleswhich are accessible to all who will know of them there are thefeeblest efforts any where made to become acquainted with them
i knowa woodchopper of middle age who takes a french paper not for news ashe says for he is above that but to “keep himself in practice” hebeing a canadian by birth and when i ask him what he considers thebest thing he can do in this world he says beside this to keep upand add to his english
this is about as much as the college bredgenerally do or aspire to do and they take an english paper for thepurpose
one who has just come from reading perhaps one of the bestenglish books will find how many with whom he can converse about it
orsuppose he comes from reading a greek or latin classic in the originalwhose praises are familiar even to the so called illiterate he willfind nobody at all to speak to but must keep silence about it
indeedthere is hardly the professor in our colleges who if he has masteredthe difficulties of the language has proportionally mastered thedifficulties of the wit and poetry of a greek poet and has anysympathy to impart to the alert and heroic reader and as for thesacred scriptures or bibles of mankind who in this town can tell meeven their titles
most men do not know that any nation but the hebrewshave had a scripture
a man any man will go considerably out of hisway to pick up a silver dollar but here are golden words which thewisest men of antiquity have uttered and whose worth the wise of everysucceeding age have assured us of—and yet we learn to read only as faras easy reading the primers and class-books and when we leave schoolthe “little reading” and story books which are for boys andbeginners and our reading our conversation and thinking are all on avery low level worthy only of pygmies and manikins
i aspire to be acquainted with wiser men than this our concord soil hasproduced whose names are hardly known here
or shall i hear the nameof plato and never read his book
as if plato were my townsman and inever saw him—my next neighbor and i never heard him speak or attendedto the wisdom of his words
but how actually is it
his dialogueswhich contain what was immortal in him lie on the next shelf and yeti never read them
we are underbred and low-lived and illiterate andin this respect i confess i do not make any very broad distinctionbetween the illiterateness of my townsman who cannot read at all andthe illiterateness of him who has learned to read only what is forchildren and feeble intellects
we should be as good as the worthies ofantiquity but partly by first knowing how good they were
we are arace of tit-men and soar but little higher in our intellectual flightsthan the columns of the daily paper
it is not all books that are as dull as their readers
there areprobably words addressed to our condition exactly which if we couldreally hear and understand would be more salutary than the morning orthe spring to our lives and possibly put a new aspect on the face ofthings for us
how many a man has dated a new era in his life from thereading of a book
the book exists for us perchance which will explainour miracles and reveal new ones
the at present unutterable things wemay find somewhere uttered
these same questions that disturb andpuzzle and confound us have in their turn occurred to all the wise mennot one has been omitted and each has answered them according to hisability by his words and his life
moreover with wisdom we shalllearn liberality
the solitary hired man on a farm in the outskirts ofconcord who has had his second birth and peculiar religiousexperience and is driven as he believes into the silent gravity andexclusiveness by his faith may think it is not true but zoroasterthousands of years ago travelled the same road and had the sameexperience but he being wise knew it to be universal and treatedhis neighbors accordingly and is even said to have invented andestablished worship among men
let him humbly commune with zoroasterthen and through the liberalizing influence of all the worthies withjesus christ himself and let “our church” go by the board
we boast that we belong to the nineteenth century and are making themost rapid strides of any nation
but consider how little this villagedoes for its own culture
i do not wish to flatter my townsmen nor tobe flattered by them for that will not advance either of us
we needto be provoked—goaded like oxen as we are into a trot
we have acomparatively decent system of common schools schools for infantsonly but excepting the half-starved lyceum in the winter and latterlythe puny beginning of a library suggested by the state no school forourselves
we spend more on almost any article of bodily aliment orailment than on our mental aliment
it is time that we had uncommonschools that we did not leave off our education when we begin to bemen and women
it is time that villages were universities and theirelder inhabitants the fellows of universities with leisure—if they areindeed so well off—to pursue liberal studies the rest of their lives
shall the world be confined to one paris or one oxford forever
cannotstudents be boarded here and get a liberal education under the skies ofconcord
can we not hire some abelard to lecture to us
alas
what withfoddering the cattle and tending the store we are kept from school toolong and our education is sadly neglected
in this country thevillage should in some respects take the place of the nobleman ofeurope
it should be the patron of the fine arts
it is rich enough
itwants only the magnanimity and refinement
it can spend money enough onsuch things as farmers and traders value but it is thought utopian topropose spending money for things which more intelligent men know to beof far more worth
this town has spent seventeen thousand dollars on atown-house thank fortune or politics but probably it will not spendso much on living wit the true meat to put into that shell in ahundred years
the one hundred and twenty-five dollars annuallysubscribed for a lyceum in the winter is better spent than any otherequal sum raised in the town
if we live in the nineteenth century whyshould we not enjoy the advantages which the nineteenth century offers
why should our life be in any respect provincial
if we will readnewspapers why not skip the gossip of boston and take the bestnewspaper in the world at once
—not be sucking the pap of “neutralfamily” papers or browsing “olive-branches” here in new england
letthe reports of all the learned societies come to us and we will see ifthey know any thing
why should we leave it to harper & brothers andredding & co
to select our reading
as the nobleman of cultivatedtaste surrounds himself with whatever conduces to hisculture—genius—learning—wit—books—paintings—statuary—music—philosophical instruments and the like so let the village do—notstop short at a pedagogue a parson a sexton a parish library andthree selectmen because our pilgrim forefathers got through a coldwinter once on a bleak rock with these
to act collectively isaccording to the spirit of our institutions and i am confident thatas our circumstances are more flourishing our means are greater thanthe nobleman’s
new england can hire all the wise men in the world tocome and teach her and board them round the while and not beprovincial at all
that is the _uncommon_ school we want
instead ofnoblemen let us have noble villages of men
if it is necessary omitone bridge over the river go round a little there and throw one archat least over the darker gulf of ignorance which surrounds us
soundsbut while we are confined to books though the most select and classicand read only particular written languages which are themselves butdialects and provincial we are in danger of forgetting the languagewhich all things and events speak without metaphor which alone iscopious and standard
much is published but little printed
the rayswhich stream through the shutter will be no longer remembered when theshutter is wholly removed

i did not read books the first summer i hoed beans
nay i often didbetter than this
there were times when i could not afford to sacrificethe bloom of the present moment to any work whether of the head orhands
i love a broad margin to my life
sometimes in a summermorning having taken my accustomed bath i sat in my sunny doorwayfrom sunrise till noon rapt in a revery amidst the pines andhickories and sumachs in undisturbed solitude and stillness while thebirds sing around or flitted noiseless through the house until by thesun falling in at my west window or the noise of some traveller’swagon on the distant highway i was reminded of the lapse of time
igrew in those seasons like corn in the night and they were far betterthan any work of the hands would have been
they were not timesubtracted from my life but so much over and above my usual allowance
i realized what the orientals mean by contemplation and the forsakingof works
for the most part i minded not how the hours went
the dayadvanced as if to light some work of mine it was morning and lo nowit is evening and nothing memorable is accomplished
instead ofsinging like the birds i silently smiled at my incessant good fortune
as the sparrow had its trill sitting on the hickory before my door sohad i my chuckle or suppressed warble which he might hear out of mynest
my days were not days of the week bearing the stamp of anyheathen deity nor were they minced into hours and fretted by theticking of a clock for i lived like the puri indians of whom it issaid that “for yesterday to-day and to-morrow they have only oneword and they express the variety of meaning by pointing backward foryesterday forward for to-morrow and overhead for the passing day
”this was sheer idleness to my fellow-townsmen no doubt but if thebirds and flowers had tried me by their standard i should not havebeen found wanting
a man must find his occasions in himself it istrue
the natural day is very calm and will hardly reprove hisindolence
i had this advantage at least in my mode of life over those who wereobliged to look abroad for amusement to society and the theatre thatmy life itself was become my amusement and never ceased to be novel
itwas a drama of many scenes and without an end
if we were always indeedgetting our living and regulating our lives according to the last andbest mode we had learned we should never be troubled with ennui

housework was a pleasant pastime
when myfloor was dirty i rose early and setting all my furniture out ofdoors on the grass bed and bedstead making but one budget dashedwater on the floor and sprinkled white sand from the pond on it andthen with a broom scrubbed it clean and white and by the time thevillagers had broken their fast the morning sun had dried my housesufficiently to allow me to move in again and my meditations werealmost uninterupted
it was pleasant to see my whole household effectsout on the grass making a little pile like a gypsy’s pack and mythree-legged table from which i did not remove the books and pen andink standing amid the pines and hickories
they seemed glad to get outthemselves and as if unwilling to be brought in
i was sometimestempted to stretch an awning over them and take my seat there
it wasworth the while to see the sun shine on these things and hear the freewind blow on them so much more interesting most familiar objects lookout of doors than in the house
a bird sits on the next boughlife-everlasting grows under the table and blackberry vines run roundits legs pine cones chestnut burs and strawberry leaves are strewnabout
it looked as if this was the way these forms came to betransferred to our furniture to tables chairs and bedsteads—becausethey once stood in their midst
my house was on the side of a hill immediately on the edge of thelarger wood in the midst of a young forest of pitch pines andhickories and half a dozen rods from the pond to which a narrowfootpath led down the hill
in my front yard grew the strawberryblackberry and life-everlasting johnswort and goldenrod shrub-oaksand sand-cherry blueberry and groundnut
near the end of may thesand-cherry (_cerasus pumila_) adorned the sides of the path with itsdelicate flowers arranged in umbels cylindrically about its shortstems which last in the fall weighed down with good sized andhandsome cherries fell over in wreaths like rays on every side
itasted them out of compliment to nature though they were scarcelypalatable
the sumach (_rhus glabra_) grew luxuriantly about thehouse pushing up through the embankment which i had made and growingfive or six feet the first season
its broad pinnate tropical leaf waspleasant though strange to look on
the large buds suddenly pushingout late in the spring from dry sticks which had seemed to be deaddeveloped themselves as by magic into graceful green and tender boughsan inch in diameter and sometimes as i sat at my window soheedlessly did they grow and tax their weak joints i heard a fresh andtender bough suddenly fall like a fan to the ground when there was nota breath of air stirring broken off by its own weight
in august thelarge masses of berries which when in flower had attracted many wildbees gradually assumed their bright velvety crimson hue and by theirweight again bent down and broke the tender limbs
as i sit at my window this summer afternoon hawks are circling aboutmy clearing the tantivy of wild pigeons flying by twos and threesathwart my view or perching restless on the white-pine boughs behindmy house gives a voice to the air a fishhawk dimples the glassysurface of the pond and brings up a fish a mink steals out of themarsh before my door and seizes a frog by the shore the sedge isbending under the weight of the reed-birds flitting hither and thitherand for the last half hour i have heard the rattle of railroad carsnow dying away and then reviving like the beat of a partridgeconveying travellers from boston to the country
for i did not live soout of the world as that boy who as i hear was put out to a farmer inthe east part of the town but ere long ran away and came home againquite down at the heel and homesick
he had never seen such a dull andout-of-the-way place the folks were all gone off why you couldn’teven hear the whistle
i doubt if there is such a place inmassachusetts now—     “in truth our village has become a butt     for one of those fleet railroad shafts and o’er     our peaceful plain its soothing sound is—concord
”the fitchburg railroad touches the pond about a hundred rods south ofwhere i dwell
i usually go to the village along its causeway and amas it were related to society by this link
the men on the freighttrains who go over the whole length of the road bow to me as to anold acquaintance they pass me so often and apparently they take mefor an employee and so i am
i too would fain be a track-repairersomewhere in the orbit of the earth
the whistle of the locomotive penetrates my woods summer and wintersounding like the scream of a hawk sailing over some farmer’s yardinforming me that many restless city merchants are arriving within thecircle of the town or adventurous country traders from the other side
as they come under one horizon they shout their warning to get off thetrack to the other heard sometimes through the circles of two towns
here come your groceries country your rations countrymen
nor isthere any man so independent on his farm that he can say them nay
andhere’s your pay for them
screams the countryman’s whistle timber likelong battering rams going twenty miles an hour against the city’swalls and chairs enough to seat all the weary and heavy laden thatdwell within them
with such huge and lumbering civility the countryhands a chair to the city
all the indian huckleberry hills arestripped all the cranberry meadows are raked into the city
up comesthe cotton down goes the woven cloth up comes the silk down goes thewoollen up come the books but down goes the wit that writes them
when i meet the engine with its train of cars moving off with planetarymotion—or rather like a comet for the beholder knows not if withthat velocity and with that direction it will ever revisit this systemsince its orbit does not look like a returning curve—with its steamcloud like a banner streaming behind in golden and silver wreaths likemany a downy cloud which i have seen high in the heavens unfoldingits masses to the light—as if this travelling demigod thiscloud-compeller would ere long take the sunset sky for the livery ofhis train when i hear the iron horse make the hills echo with hissnort like thunder shaking the earth with his feet and breathing fireand smoke from his nostrils (what kind of winged horse or fiery dragonthey will put into the new mythology i don’t know) it seems as if theearth had got a race now worthy to inhabit it
if all were as it seemsand men made the elements their servants for noble ends
if the cloudthat hangs over the engine were the perspiration of heroic deeds or asbeneficent as that which floats over the farmer’s fields then theelements and nature herself would cheerfully accompany men on theirerrands and be their escort
i watch the passage of the morning cars with the same feeling that i dothe rising of the sun which is hardly more regular
their train ofclouds stretching far behind and rising higher and higher going toheaven while the cars are going to boston conceals the sun for aminute and casts my distant field into the shade a celestial trainbeside which the petty train of cars which hugs the earth is but thebarb of the spear
the stabler of the iron horse was up early thiswinter morning by the light of the stars amid the mountains to fodderand harness his steed
fire too was awakened thus early to put thevital heat in him and get him off
if the enterprise were as innocentas it is early
if the snow lies deep they strap on his snow-shoesand with the giant plow plow a furrow from the mountains to theseaboard in which the cars like a following drill-barrow sprinkleall the restless men and floating merchandise in the country for seed
all day the fire-steed flies over the country stopping only that hismaster may rest and i am awakened by his tramp and defiant snort atmidnight when in some remote glen in the woods he fronts the elementsincased in ice and snow and he will reach his stall only with themorning star to start once more on his travels without rest orslumber
or perchance at evening i hear him in his stable blowing offthe superfluous energy of the day that he may calm his nerves and coolhis liver and brain for a few hours of iron slumber
if the enterprisewere as heroic and commanding as it is protracted and unwearied
far through unfrequented woods on the confines of towns where onceonly the hunter penetrated by day in the darkest night dart thesebright saloons without the knowledge of their inhabitants this momentstopping at some brilliant station-house in town or city where asocial crowd is gathered the next in the dismal swamp scaring the owland fox
the startings and arrivals of the cars are now the epochs inthe village day
they go and come with such regularity and precisionand their whistle can be heard so far that the farmers set theirclocks by them and thus one well conducted institution regulates awhole country
have not men improved somewhat in punctuality since therailroad was invented
do they not talk and think faster in the depotthan they did in the stage-office
there is something electrifying inthe atmosphere of the former place
i have been astonished at themiracles it has wrought that some of my neighbors who i should haveprophesied once for all would never get to boston by so prompt aconveyance are on hand when the bell rings
to do things “railroadfashion” is now the by-word and it is worth the while to be warned sooften and so sincerely by any power to get off its track
there is nostopping to read the riot act no firing over the heads of the mob inthis case
we have constructed a fate an _atropos_ that never turnsaside
(let that be the name of your engine
) men are advertised thatat a certain hour and minute these bolts will be shot toward particularpoints of the compass yet it interferes with no man’s business andthe children go to school on the other track
we live the steadier forit
we are all educated thus to be sons of tell
the air is full ofinvisible bolts
every path but your own is the path of fate
keep onyour own track then
what recommends commerce to me is its enterprise and bravery
it doesnot clasp its hands and pray to jupiter
i see these men every day goabout their business with more or less courage and content doing moreeven than they suspect and perchance better employed than they couldhave consciously devised
i am less affected by their heroism who stoodup for half an hour in the front line at buena vista than by thesteady and cheerful valor of the men who inhabit the snow-plough fortheir winter quarters who have not merely the three-o’-clock in themorning courage which bonaparte thought was the rarest but whosecourage does not go to rest so early who go to sleep only when thestorm sleeps or the sinews of their iron steed are frozen
on thismorning of the great snow perchance which is still raging andchilling men’s blood i hear the muffled tone of their engine bell fromout the fog bank of their chilled breath which announces that the cars_are coming_ without long delay notwithstanding the veto of a newengland north-east snow storm and i behold the ploughmen covered withsnow and rime their heads peering above the mould-board which isturning down other than daisies and the nests of field-mice likebowlders of the sierra nevada that occupy an outside place in theuniverse
commerce is unexpectedly confident and serene alert adventurous andunwearied
it is very natural in its methods withal far more so thanmany fantastic enterprises and sentimental experiments and hence itssingular success
i am refreshed and expanded when the freight trainrattles past me and i smell the stores which go dispensing their odorsall the way from long wharf to lake champlain reminding me of foreignparts of coral reefs and indian oceans and tropical climes and theextent of the globe
i feel more like a citizen of the world at thesight of the palm-leaf which will cover so many flaxen new englandheads the next summer the manilla hemp and cocoa-nut husks the oldjunk gunny bags scrap iron and rusty nails
this car-load of tornsails is more legible and interesting now than if they should bewrought into paper and printed books
who can write so graphically thehistory of the storms they have weathered as these rents have done
they are proof-sheets which need no correction

this closed car smellsof salt fish the strong new england and commercial scent reminding meof the grand banks and the fisheries

next spanish hides with the tails still preserving their twist and theangle of elevation they had when the oxen that wore them were careeringover the pampas of the spanish main—a type of all obstinacy andevincing how almost hopeless and incurable are all constitutionalvices
i confess that practically speaking when i have learned aman’s real disposition i have no hopes of changing it for the betteror worse in this state of existence
as the orientals say “a cur’stail may be warmed and pressed and bound round with ligatures andafter a twelve years’ labor bestowed upon it still it will retain itsnatural form
” the only effectual cure for such inveteracies as thesetails exhibit is to make glue of them which i believe is what isusually done with them and then they will stay put and stick
here isa hogshead of molasses or of brandy directed to john smithcuttingsville vermont some trader among the green mountains whoimports for the farmers near his clearing and now perchance standsover his bulk-head and thinks of the last arrivals on the coast howthey may affect the price for him telling his customers this momentas he has told them twenty times before this morning that he expectssome by the next train of prime quality

warned by the whizzingsound i look up from my book and see some tall pine hewn on farnorthern hills which has winged its way over the green mountains andthe connecticut shot like an arrow through the township within tenminutes and scarce another eye beholds it going     “to be the mast     of some great ammiral
”and hark
here comes the cattle-train bearing the cattle of a thousandhills sheepcots stables and cow-yards in the air drovers with theirsticks and shepherd boys in the midst of their flocks all but themountain pastures whirled along like leaves blown from the mountainsby the september gales
the air is filled with the bleating of calvesand sheep and the hustling of oxen as if a pastoral valley were goingby
when the old bell-wether at the head rattles his bell themountains do indeed skip like rams and the little hills like lambs
acar-load of drovers too in the midst on a level with their drovesnow their vocation gone but still clinging to their useless sticks astheir badge of office
but their dogs where are they
it is a stampedeto them they are quite thrown out they have lost the scent
methinksi hear them barking behind the peterboro’ hills or panting up thewestern slope of the green mountains
they will not be in at the death
their vocation too is gone
their fidelity and sagacity are below parnow
they will slink back to their kennels in disgrace or perchancerun wild and strike a league with the wolf and the fox
so is yourpastoral life whirled past and away
but the bell rings and i must getoff the track and let the cars go by—     what’s the railroad to me
i never go to see     where it ends
it fills a few hollows     and makes banks for the swallows     it sets the sand a-blowing     and the blackberries a-growingbut i cross it like a cart-path in the woods
i will not have my eyesput out and my ears spoiled by its smoke and steam and hissing
now that the cars are gone by and all the restless world with them andthe fishes in the pond no longer feel their rumbling i am more alonethan ever
for the rest of the long afternoon perhaps my meditationsare interrupted only by the faint rattle of a carriage or team alongthe distant highway
sometimes on sundays i heard the bells the lincoln acton bedfordor concord bell when the wind was favorable a faint sweet and asit were natural melody worth importing into the wilderness
at asufficient distance over the woods this sound acquires a certainvibratory hum as if the pine needles in the horizon were the stringsof a harp which it swept
all sound heard at the greatest possibledistance produces one and the same effect a vibration of the universallyre just as the intervening atmosphere makes a distant ridge of earthinteresting to our eyes by the azure tint it imparts to it
there cameto me in this case a melody which the air had strained and which hadconversed with every leaf and needle of the wood that portion of thesound which the elements had taken up and modulated and echoed fromvale to vale
the echo is to some extent an original sound andtherein is the magic and charm of it
it is not merely a repetition ofwhat was worth repeating in the bell but partly the voice of the woodthe same trivial words and notes sung by a wood-nymph
at evening the distant lowing of some cow in the horizon beyond thewoods sounded sweet and melodious and at first i would mistake it forthe voices of certain minstrels by whom i was sometimes serenaded whomight be straying over hill and dale but soon i was not unpleasantlydisappointed when it was prolonged into the cheap and natural music ofthe cow
i do not mean to be satirical but to express my appreciationof those youths’ singing when i state that i perceived clearly that itwas akin to the music of the cow and they were at length onearticulation of nature
regularly at half past seven in one part of the summer after theevening train had gone by the whippoorwills chanted their vespers forhalf an hour sitting on a stump by my door or upon the ridge pole ofthe house
they would begin to sing almost with as much precision as aclock within five minutes of a particular time referred to thesetting of the sun every evening
i had a rare opportunity to becomeacquainted with their habits
sometimes i heard four or five at once indifferent parts of the wood by accident one a bar behind another andso near me that i distinguished not only the cluck after each note butoften that singular buzzing sound like a fly in a spider’s web onlyproportionally louder
sometimes one would circle round and round me inthe woods a few feet distant as if tethered by a string when probablyi was near its eggs
they sang at intervals throughout the night andwere again as musical as ever just before and about dawn
when other birds are still the screech owls take up the strain likemourning women their ancient u-lu-lu
their dismal scream is truly benjonsonian
wise midnight hags
it is no honest and blunt tu-whit tu-whoof the poets but without jesting a most solemn graveyard ditty themutual consolations of suicide lovers remembering the pangs and thedelights of supernal love in the infernal groves
yet i love to heartheir wailing their doleful responses trilled along the wood-sidereminding me sometimes of music and singing birds as if it were thedark and tearful side of music the regrets and sighs that would fainbe sung
they are the spirits the low spirits and melancholyforebodings of fallen souls that once in human shape night-walked theearth and did the deeds of darkness now expiating their sins withtheir wailing hymns or threnodies in the scenery of theirtransgressions
they give me a new sense of the variety and capacity ofthat nature which is our common dwelling
_oh-o-o-o-o that i never hadbeen bor-r-r-r-n
_ sighs one on this side of the pond and circles withthe restlessness of despair to some new perch on the gray oaks
then—_that i never had been bor-r-r-r-n
_ echoes another on the fartherside with tremulous sincerity and—_bor-r-r-r-n
_ comes faintly fromfar in the lincoln woods
i was also serenaded by a hooting owl
near at hand you could fancy itthe most melancholy sound in nature as if she meant by this tostereotype and make permanent in her choir the dying moans of a humanbeing—some poor weak relic of mortality who has left hope behind andhowls like an animal yet with human sobs on entering the dark valleymade more awful by a certain gurgling melodiousness—i find myselfbeginning with the letters gl when i try to imitate it—expressive of amind which has reached the gelatinous mildewy stage in themortification of all healthy and courageous thought
it reminded me ofghouls and idiots and insane howlings
but now one answers from farwoods in a strain made really melodious by distance—_hoo hoo hoohoorer hoo_ and indeed for the most part it suggested only pleasingassociations whether heard by day or night summer or winter
i rejoice that there are owls
let them do the idiotic and maniacalhooting for men
it is a sound admirably suited to swamps and twilightwoods which no day illustrates suggesting a vast and undevelopednature which men have not recognized
they represent the stark twilightand unsatisfied thoughts which all have
all day the sun has shone onthe surface of some savage swamp where the single spruce stands hungwith usnea lichens and small hawks circulate above and the chickadeelisps amid the evergreens and the partridge and rabbit skulk beneathbut now a more dismal and fitting day dawns and a different race ofcreatures awakes to express the meaning of nature there
late in the evening i heard the distant rumbling of wagons overbridges—a sound heard farther than almost any other at night—thebaying of dogs and sometimes again the lowing of some disconsolate cowin a distant barn-yard
in the mean while all the shore rang with thetrump of bullfrogs the sturdy spirits of ancient wine-bibbers andwassailers still unrepentant trying to sing a catch in their stygianlake—if the walden nymphs will pardon the comparison for though thereare almost no weeds there are frogs there—who would fain keep up thehilarious rules of their old festal tables though their voices havewaxed hoarse and solemnly grave mocking at mirth and the wine haslost its flavor and become only liquor to distend their paunches andsweet intoxication never comes to drown the memory of the past butmere saturation and waterloggedness and distention
the mostaldermanic with his chin upon a heart-leaf which serves for a napkinto his drooling chaps under this northern shore quaffs a deep draughtof the once scorned water and passes round the cup with theejaculation _tr-r-r-oonk tr-r-r-oonk tr-r-r-oonk
_ and straightwaycomes over the water from some distant cove the same password repeatedwhere the next in seniority and girth has gulped down to his mark andwhen this observance has made the circuit of the shores thenejaculates the master of ceremonies with satisfaction _tr-r-r-oonk
_and each in his turn repeats the same down to the least distendedleakiest and flabbiest paunched that there be no mistake and thenthe bowl goes round again and again until the sun disperses themorning mist and only the patriarch is not under the pond but vainlybellowing _troonk_ from time to time and pausing for a reply
i am not sure that i ever heard the sound of cock-crowing from myclearing and i thought that it might be worth the while to keep acockerel for his music merely as a singing bird
the note of this oncewild indian pheasant is certainly the most remarkable of any bird’sand if they could be naturalized without being domesticated it wouldsoon become the most famous sound in our woods surpassing the clangorof the goose and the hooting of the owl and then imagine the cacklingof the hens to fill the pauses when their lords’ clarions rested
nowonder that man added this bird to his tame stock—to say nothing ofthe eggs and drumsticks
to walk in a winter morning in a wood wherethese birds abounded their native woods and hear the wild cockerelscrow on the trees clear and shrill for miles over the resoundingearth drowning the feebler notes of other birds—think of it
it wouldput nations on the alert
who would not be early to rise and riseearlier and earlier every successive day of his life till he becameunspeakably healthy wealthy and wise
this foreign bird’s note iscelebrated by the poets of all countries along with the notes of theirnative songsters
all climates agree with brave chanticleer
he is moreindigenous even than the natives
his health is ever good his lungsare sound his spirits never flag
even the sailor on the atlantic andpacific is awakened by his voice but its shrill sound never roused mefrom my slumbers
i kept neither dog cat cow pig nor hens so thatyou would have said there was a deficiency of domestic sounds neitherthe churn nor the spinning wheel nor even the singing of the kettlenor the hissing of the urn nor children crying to comfort one
anold-fashioned man would have lost his senses or died of ennui beforethis
not even rats in the wall for they were starved out or ratherwere never baited in—only squirrels on the roof and under the floor awhippoorwill on the ridge pole a blue-jay screaming beneath thewindow a hare or woodchuck under the house a screech-owl or a cat-owlbehind it a flock of wild geese or a laughing loon on the pond and afox to bark in the night
not even a lark or an oriole those mildplantation birds ever visited my clearing
no cockerels to crow norhens to cackle in the yard
no yard
but unfenced nature reaching up toyour very sills
a young forest growing up under your meadows and wildsumachs and blackberry vines breaking through into your cellar sturdypitch pines rubbing and creaking against the shingles for want of roomtheir roots reaching quite under the house
instead of a scuttle or ablind blown off in the gale—a pine tree snapped off or torn up by theroots behind your house for fuel
instead of no path to the front-yardgate in the great snow—no gate—no front-yard—and no path to thecivilized world
solitudethis is a delicious evening when the whole body is one sense andimbibes delight through every pore
i go and come with a strangeliberty in nature a part of herself
as i walk along the stony shoreof the pond in my shirt sleeves though it is cool as well as cloudyand windy and i see nothing special to attract me all the elementsare unusually congenial to me
the bullfrogs trump to usher in thenight and the note of the whippoorwill is borne on the rippling windfrom over the water
sympathy with the fluttering alder and poplarleaves almost takes away my breath yet like the lake my serenity isrippled but not ruffled
these small waves raised by the evening windare as remote from storm as the smooth reflecting surface
though it isnow dark the wind still blows and roars in the wood the waves stilldash and some creatures lull the rest with their notes
the repose isnever complete
the wildest animals do not repose but seek their preynow the fox and skunk and rabbit now roam the fields and woodswithout fear
they are nature’s watchmen—links which connect the daysof animated life
when i return to my house i find that visitors have been there and lefttheir cards either a bunch of flowers or a wreath of evergreen or aname in pencil on a yellow walnut leaf or a chip
they who come rarelyto the woods take some little piece of the forest into their hands toplay with by the way which they leave either intentionally oraccidentally
one has peeled a willow wand woven it into a ring anddropped it on my table
i could always tell if visitors had called inmy absence either by the bended twigs or grass or the print of theirshoes and generally of what sex or age or quality they were by someslight trace left as a flower dropped or a bunch of grass plucked andthrown away even as far off as the railroad half a mile distant orby the lingering odor of a cigar or pipe
nay i was frequentlynotified of the passage of a traveller along the highway sixty rods offby the scent of his pipe
there is commonly sufficient space about us
our horizon is never quiteat our elbows
the thick wood is not just at our door nor the pondbut somewhat is always clearing familiar and worn by us appropriatedand fenced in some way and reclaimed from nature
for what reason havei this vast range and circuit some square miles of unfrequentedforest for my privacy abandoned to me by men
my nearest neighbor isa mile distant and no house is visible from any place but thehill-tops within half a mile of my own
i have my horizon bounded bywoods all to myself a distant view of the railroad where it touchesthe pond on the one hand and of the fence which skirts the woodlandroad on the other
but for the most part it is as solitary where i liveas on the prairies
it is as much asia or africa as new england
ihave as it were my own sun and moon and stars and a little world allto myself
at night there was never a traveller passed my house orknocked at my door more than if i were the first or last man unlessit were in the spring when at long intervals some came from thevillage to fish for pouts—they plainly fished much more in the waldenpond of their own natures and baited their hooks with darkness—butthey soon retreated usually with light baskets and left “the world todarkness and to me” and the black kernel of the night was neverprofaned by any human neighborhood
i believe that men are generallystill a little afraid of the dark though the witches are all hung andchristianity and candles have been introduced
yet i experienced sometimes that the most sweet and tender the mostinnocent and encouraging society may be found in any natural objecteven for the poor misanthrope and most melancholy man
there can be novery black melancholy to him who lives in the midst of nature and hashis senses still
there was never yet such a storm but it was æolianmusic to a healthy and innocent ear
nothing can rightly compel asimple and brave man to a vulgar sadness
while i enjoy the friendshipof the seasons i trust that nothing can make life a burden to me
thegentle rain which waters my beans and keeps me in the house to-day isnot drear and melancholy but good for me too
though it prevents myhoeing them it is of far more worth than my hoeing
if it shouldcontinue so long as to cause the seeds to rot in the ground and destroythe potatoes in the low lands it would still be good for the grass onthe uplands and being good for the grass it would be good for me
sometimes when i compare myself with other men it seems as if i weremore favored by the gods than they beyond any deserts that i amconscious of as if i had a warrant and surety at their hands which myfellows have not and were especially guided and guarded
i do notflatter myself but if it be possible they flatter me
i have neverfelt lonesome or in the least oppressed by a sense of solitude butonce and that was a few weeks after i came to the woods when for anhour i doubted if the near neighborhood of man was not essential to aserene and healthy life
to be alone was something unpleasant
but iwas at the same time conscious of a slight insanity in my mood andseemed to foresee my recovery
in the midst of a gentle rain whilethese thoughts prevailed i was suddenly sensible of such sweet andbeneficent society in nature in the very pattering of the drops andin every sound and sight around my house an infinite and unaccountablefriendliness all at once like an atmosphere sustaining me as made thefancied advantages of human neighborhood insignificant and i havenever thought of them since
every little pine needle expanded andswelled with sympathy and befriended me
i was so distinctly made awareof the presence of something kindred to me even in scenes which we areaccustomed to call wild and dreary and also that the nearest of bloodto me and humanest was not a person nor a villager that i thought noplace could ever be strange to me again
—     “mourning untimely consumes the sad     few are their days in the land of the living     beautiful daughter of toscar
”some of my pleasantest hours were during the long rain storms in thespring or fall which confined me to the house for the afternoon aswell as the forenoon soothed by their ceaseless roar and pelting whenan early twilight ushered in a long evening in which many thoughts hadtime to take root and unfold themselves
in those driving north-eastrains which tried the village houses so when the maids stood readywith mop and pail in front entries to keep the deluge out i sat behindmy door in my little house which was all entry and thoroughly enjoyedits protection
in one heavy thunder shower the lightning struck alarge pitch-pine across the pond making a very conspicuous andperfectly regular spiral groove from top to bottom an inch or moredeep and four or five inches wide as you would groove awalking-stick
i passed it again the other day and was struck with aweon looking up and beholding that mark now more distinct than everwhere a terrific and resistless bolt came down out of the harmless skyeight years ago
men frequently say to me “i should think you wouldfeel lonesome down there and want to be nearer to folks rainy andsnowy days and nights especially
” i am tempted to reply to such—thiswhole earth which we inhabit is but a point in space
how far apartthink you dwell the two most distant inhabitants of yonder star thebreadth of whose disk cannot be appreciated by our instruments
whyshould i feel lonely
is not our planet in the milky way
this whichyou put seems to me not to be the most important question
what sort ofspace is that which separates a man from his fellows and makes himsolitary
i have found that no exertion of the legs can bring two mindsmuch nearer to one another
what do we want most to dwell near to
notto many men surely the depot the post-office the bar-room themeeting-house the school-house the grocery beacon hill or the fivepoints where men most congregate but to the perennial source of ourlife whence in all our experience we have found that to issue as thewillow stands near the water and sends out its roots in that direction
this will vary with different natures but this is the place where awise man will dig his cellar



i one evening overtook one of mytownsmen who has accumulated what is called “a handsomeproperty”—though i never got a _fair_ view of it—on the walden roaddriving a pair of cattle to market who inquired of me how i couldbring my mind to give up so many of the comforts of life
i answeredthat i was very sure i liked it passably well i was not joking
and soi went home to my bed and left him to pick his way through thedarkness and the mud to brighton—or bright-town—which place he wouldreach some time in the morning
any prospect of awakening or coming to life to a dead man makesindifferent all times and places
the place where that may occur isalways the same and indescribably pleasant to all our senses
for themost part we allow only outlying and transient circumstances to makeour occasions
they are in fact the cause of our distraction
nearestto all things is that power which fashions their being
_next_ to usthe grandest laws are continually being executed
_next_ to us is notthe workman whom we have hired with whom we love so well to talk butthe workman whose work we are
“how vast and profound is the influence of the subtile powers of heavenand of earth
”“we seek to perceive them and we do not see them we seek to hearthem and we do not hear them identified with the substance of thingsthey cannot be separated from them
”“they cause that in all the universe men purify and sanctify theirhearts and clothe themselves in their holiday garments to offersacrifices and oblations to their ancestors
it is an ocean of subtileintelligences
they are every where above us on our left on ourright they environ us on all sides
”we are the subjects of an experiment which is not a little interestingto me
can we not do without the society of our gossips a little whileunder these circumstances—have our own thoughts to cheer us
confuciussays truly “virtue does not remain as an abandoned orphan it must ofnecessity have neighbors
”with thinking we may be beside ourselves in a sane sense
by aconscious effort of the mind we can stand aloof from actions and theirconsequences and all things good and bad go by us like a torrent
weare not wholly involved in nature
i may be either the drift-wood inthe stream or indra in the sky looking down on it
i _may_ be affectedby a theatrical exhibition on the other hand i _may not_ be affectedby an actual event which appears to concern me much more
i only knowmyself as a human entity the scene so to speak of thoughts andaffections and am sensible of a certain doubleness by which i canstand as remote from myself as from another
however intense myexperience i am conscious of the presence and criticism of a part ofme which as it were is not a part of me but spectator sharing noexperience but taking note of it and that is no more i than it isyou
when the play it may be the tragedy of life is over thespectator goes his way
it was a kind of fiction a work of theimagination only so far as he was concerned
this doubleness mayeasily make us poor neighbors and friends sometimes
i find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time
to be incompany even with the best is soon wearisome and dissipating
i loveto be alone
i never found the companion that was so companionable assolitude
we are for the most part more lonely when we go abroad amongmen than when we stay in our chambers
a man thinking or working isalways alone let him be where he will
solitude is not measured by themiles of space that intervene between a man and his fellows
the reallydiligent student in one of the crowded hives of cambridge college is assolitary as a dervish in the desert
the farmer can work alone in thefield or the woods all day hoeing or chopping and not feel lonesomebecause he is employed but when he comes home at night he cannot sitdown in a room alone at the mercy of his thoughts but must be wherehe can “see the folks” and recreate and as he thinks remuneratehimself for his day’s solitude and hence he wonders how the studentcan sit alone in the house all night and most of the day without ennuiand “the blues” but he does not realize that the student though inthe house is still at work in _his_ field and chopping in _his_woods as the farmer in his and in turn seeks the same recreation andsociety that the latter does though it may be a more condensed form ofit
society is commonly too cheap
we meet at very short intervals nothaving had time to acquire any new value for each other
we meet atmeals three times a day and give each other a new taste of that oldmusty cheese that we are
we have had to agree on a certain set ofrules called etiquette and politeness to make this frequent meetingtolerable and that we need not come to open war
we meet at thepost-office and at the sociable and about the fireside every nightwe live thick and are in each other’s way and stumble over oneanother and i think that we thus lose some respect for one another
certainly less frequency would suffice for all important and heartycommunications
consider the girls in a factory—never alone hardly intheir dreams
it would be better if there were but one inhabitant to asquare mile as where i live
the value of a man is not in his skinthat we should touch him
i have heard of a man lost in the woods and dying of famine andexhaustion at the foot of a tree whose loneliness was relieved by thegrotesque visions with which owing to bodily weakness his diseasedimagination surrounded him and which he believed to be real
so alsoowing to bodily and mental health and strength we may be continuallycheered by a like but more normal and natural society and come to knowthat we are never alone
i have a great deal of company in my house especially in the morningwhen nobody calls
let me suggest a few comparisons that some one mayconvey an idea of my situation
i am no more lonely than the loon inthe pond that laughs so loud or than walden pond itself
what companyhas that lonely lake i pray
and yet it has not the blue devils butthe blue angels in it in the azure tint of its waters
the sun isalone except in thick weather when there sometimes appear to be twobut one is a mock sun
god is alone—but the devil he is far frombeing alone he sees a great deal of company he is legion
i am nomore lonely than a single mullein or dandelion in a pasture or a beanleaf or sorrel or a horse-fly or a bumble-bee
i am no more lonelythan the mill brook or a weathercock or the north star or the southwind or an april shower or a january thaw or the first spider in anew house
i have occasional visits in the long winter evenings when the snowfalls fast and the wind howls in the wood from an old settler andoriginal proprietor who is reported to have dug walden pond andstoned it and fringed it with pine woods who tells me stories of oldtime and of new eternity and between us we manage to pass a cheerfulevening with social mirth and pleasant views of things even withoutapples or cider—a most wise and humorous friend whom i love much whokeeps himself more secret than ever did goffe or whalley and though heis thought to be dead none can show where he is buried
an elderlydame too dwells in my neighborhood invisible to most persons inwhose odorous herb garden i love to stroll sometimes gathering simplesand listening to her fables for she has a genius of unequalledfertility and her memory runs back farther than mythology and she cantell me the original of every fable and on what fact every one isfounded for the incidents occurred when she was young
a ruddy andlusty old dame who delights in all weathers and seasons and is likelyto outlive all her children yet
the indescribable innocence and beneficence of nature—of sun and windand rain of summer and winter—such health such cheer they affordforever
and such sympathy have they ever with our race that allnature would be affected and the sun’s brightness fade and the windswould sigh humanely and the clouds rain tears and the woods shedtheir leaves and put on mourning in midsummer if any man should everfor a just cause grieve
shall i not have intelligence with the earth
am i not partly leaves and vegetable mould myself
what is the pill which will keep us well serene contented
not my orthy great-grandfather’s but our great-grandmother nature’s universalvegetable botanic medicines by which she has kept herself youngalways outlived so many old parrs in her day and fed her health withtheir decaying fatness
for my panacea instead of one of those quackvials of a mixture dipped from acheron and the dead sea which come outof those long shallow black-schooner looking wagons which we sometimessee made to carry bottles let me have a draught of undiluted morningair
morning air
if men will not drink of this at the fountain-head ofthe day why then we must even bottle up some and sell it in theshops for the benefit of those who have lost their subscription ticketto morning time in this world
but remember it will not keep quitetill noon-day even in the coolest cellar but drive out the stoppleslong ere that and follow westward the steps of aurora
i am noworshipper of hygeia who was the daughter of that old herb-doctoræsculapius and who is represented on monuments holding a serpent inone hand and in the other a cup out of which the serpent sometimesdrinks but rather of hebe cupbearer to jupiter who was the daughterof juno and wild lettuce and who had the power of restoring gods andmen to the vigor of youth
she was probably the only thoroughlysound-conditioned healthy and robust young lady that ever walked theglobe and wherever she came it was spring
visitorsi think that i love society as much as most and am ready enough tofasten myself like a bloodsucker for the time to any full-blooded manthat comes in my way
i am naturally no hermit but might possibly sitout the sturdiest frequenter of the bar-room if my business called methither
i had three chairs in my house one for solitude two for friendshipthree for society
when visitors came in larger and unexpected numbersthere was but the third chair for them all but they generallyeconomized the room by standing up
it is surprising how many great menand women a small house will contain
i have had twenty-five or thirtysouls with their bodies at once under my roof and yet we oftenparted without being aware that we had come very near to one another
many of our houses both public and private with their almostinnumerable apartments their huge halls and their cellars for thestorage of wines and other munitions of peace appear to meextravagantly large for their inhabitants
they are so vast andmagnificent that the latter seem to be only vermin which infest them
iam surprised when the herald blows his summons before some tremont orastor or middlesex house to see come creeping out over the piazza forall inhabitants a ridiculous mouse which soon again slinks into somehole in the pavement
one inconvenience i sometimes experienced in so small a house thedifficulty of getting to a sufficient distance from my guest when webegan to utter the big thoughts in big words
you want room for yourthoughts to get into sailing trim and run a course or two before theymake their port
the bullet of your thought must have overcome itslateral and ricochet motion and fallen into its last and steady coursebefore it reaches the ear of the hearer else it may plough out againthrough the side of his head
also our sentences wanted room to unfoldand form their columns in the interval
individuals like nations musthave suitable broad and natural boundaries even a considerable neutralground between them
i have found it a singular luxury to talk acrossthe pond to a companion on the opposite side
in my house we were sonear that we could not begin to hear—we could not speak low enough tobe heard as when you throw two stones into calm water so near thatthey break each other’s undulations
if we are merely loquacious andloud talkers then we can afford to stand very near together cheek byjowl and feel each other’s breath but if we speak reservedly andthoughtfully we want to be farther apart that all animal heat andmoisture may have a chance to evaporate
if we would enjoy the mostintimate society with that in each of us which is without or abovebeing spoken to we must not only be silent but commonly so far apartbodily that we cannot possibly hear each other’s voice in any case
referred to this standard speech is for the convenience of those whoare hard of hearing but there are many fine things which we cannot sayif we have to shout
as the conversation began to assume a loftier andgrander tone we gradually shoved our chairs farther apart till theytouched the wall in opposite corners and then commonly there was notroom enough
my “best” room however my withdrawing room always ready for companyon whose carpet the sun rarely fell was the pine wood behind my house
thither in summer days when distinguished guests came i took themand a priceless domestic swept the floor and dusted the furniture andkept the things in order
if one guest came he sometimes partook of my frugal meal and it was nointerruption to conversation to be stirring a hasty-pudding orwatching the rising and maturing of a loaf of bread in the ashes inthe mean while
but if twenty came and sat in my house there wasnothing said about dinner though there might be bread enough for twomore than if eating were a forsaken habit but we naturally practisedabstinence and this was never felt to be an offence againsthospitality but the most proper and considerate course
the waste anddecay of physical life which so often needs repair seemedmiraculously retarded in such a case and the vital vigor stood itsground
i could entertain thus a thousand as well as twenty and if anyever went away disappointed or hungry from my house when they found meat home they may depend upon it that i sympathized with them at least
so easy is it though many housekeepers doubt it to establish new andbetter customs in the place of the old
you need not rest yourreputation on the dinners you give
for my own part i was never soeffectually deterred from frequenting a man’s house by any kind ofcerberus whatever as by the parade one made about dining me which itook to be a very polite and roundabout hint never to trouble him soagain
i think i shall never revisit those scenes
i should be proud tohave for the motto of my cabin those lines of spenser which one of myvisitors inscribed on a yellow walnut leaf for a card—     “arrivéd there the little house they fill         ne looke for entertainment where none was     rest is their feast and all things at their will         the noblest mind the best contentment has
”when winslow afterward governor of the plymouth colony went with acompanion on a visit of ceremony to massasoit on foot through thewoods and arrived tired and hungry at his lodge they were wellreceived by the king but nothing was said about eating that day
whenthe night arrived to quote their own words—“he laid us on the bedwith himself and his wife they at the one end and we at the other itbeing only planks laid a foot from the ground and a thin mat uponthem
two more of his chief men for want of room pressed by and uponus so that we were worse weary of our lodging than of our journey
” atone o’clock the next day massasoit “brought two fishes that he hadshot” about thrice as big as a bream “these being boiled there wereat least forty looked for a share in them
the most ate of them
thismeal only we had in two nights and a day and had not one of us boughta partridge we had taken our journey fasting
” fearing that they wouldbe light-headed for want of food and also sleep owing to “the savages’barbarous singing (for they used to sing themselves asleep)” and thatthey might get home while they had strength to travel they departed
as for lodging it is true they were but poorly entertained thoughwhat they found an inconvenience was no doubt intended for an honorbut as far as eating was concerned i do not see how the indians couldhave done better
they had nothing to eat themselves and they werewiser than to think that apologies could supply the place of food totheir guests so they drew their belts tighter and said nothing aboutit
another time when winslow visited them it being a season of plentywith them there was no deficiency in this respect
as for men they will hardly fail one any where
i had more visitorswhile i lived in the woods than at any other period in my life i meanthat i had some
i met several there under more favorable circumstancesthan i could any where else
but fewer came to see me on trivialbusiness
in this respect my company was winnowed by my mere distancefrom town
i had withdrawn so far within the great ocean of solitudeinto which the rivers of society empty that for the most part so faras my needs were concerned only the finest sediment was depositedaround me
beside there were wafted to me evidences of unexplored anduncultivated continents on the other side
who should come to my lodge this morning but a true homeric orpaphlagonian man—he had so suitable and poetic a name that i am sorryi cannot print it here—a canadian a woodchopper and post-maker whocan hole fifty posts in a day who made his last supper on a woodchuckwhich his dog caught
he too has heard of homer and “if it were notfor books” would “not know what to do rainy days” though perhaps hehas not read one wholly through for many rainy seasons
some priest whocould pronounce the greek itself taught him to read his verse in thetestament in his native parish far away and now i must translate tohim while he holds the book achilles’ reproof to patroclus for hissad countenance
—“why are you in tears patroclus like a young girl
”—     “or have you alone heard some news from phthia
they say that menœtius lives yet son of actor     and peleus lives son of æacus among the myrmidons     either of whom having died we should greatly grieve
”he says “that’s good
” he has a great bundle of white-oak bark underhis arm for a sick man gathered this sunday morning
“i supposethere’s no harm in going after such a thing to-day” says he
to himhomer was a great writer though what his writing was about he did notknow
a more simple and natural man it would be hard to find
vice anddisease which cast such a sombre moral hue over the world seemed tohave hardly any existence for him
he was about twenty-eight years oldand had left canada and his father’s house a dozen years before to workin the states and earn money to buy a farm with at last perhaps inhis native country
he was cast in the coarsest mould a stout butsluggish body yet gracefully carried with a thick sunburnt neck darkbushy hair and dull sleepy blue eyes which were occasionally lit upwith expression
he wore a flat gray cloth cap a dingy wool-coloredgreatcoat and cowhide boots
he was a great consumer of meat usuallycarrying his dinner to his work a couple of miles past my house—for hechopped all summer—in a tin pail cold meats often cold woodchucksand coffee in a stone bottle which dangled by a string from his beltand sometimes he offered me a drink
he came along early crossing mybean-field though without anxiety or haste to get to his work such asyankees exhibit
he wasn’t a-going to hurt himself
he didn’t care ifhe only earned his board
frequently he would leave his dinner in thebushes when his dog had caught a woodchuck by the way and go back amile and a half to dress it and leave it in the cellar of the housewhere he boarded after deliberating first for half an hour whether hecould not sink it in the pond safely till nightfall—loving to dwelllong upon these themes
he would say as he went by in the morning“how thick the pigeons are
if working every day were not my trade icould get all the meat i should want by hunting—pigeons woodchucksrabbits partridges—by gosh
i could get all i should want for a weekin one day
”he was a skilful chopper and indulged in some flourishes and ornamentsin his art
he cut his trees level and close to the ground that thesprouts which came up afterward might be more vigorous and a sled mightslide over the stumps and instead of leaving a whole tree to supporthis corded wood he would pare it away to a slender stake or splinterwhich you could break off with your hand at last
he interested me because he was so quiet and solitary and so happywithal a well of good humor and contentment which overflowed at hiseyes
his mirth was without alloy
sometimes i saw him at his work inthe woods felling trees and he would greet me with a laugh ofinexpressible satisfaction and a salutation in canadian french thoughhe spoke english as well
when i approached him he would suspend hiswork and with half-suppressed mirth lie along the trunk of a pinewhich he had felled and peeling off the inner bark roll it up into aball and chew it while he laughed and talked
such an exuberance ofanimal spirits had he that he sometimes tumbled down and rolled on theground with laughter at any thing which made him think and tickled him
looking round upon the trees he would exclaim—“by george
i can enjoymyself well enough here chopping i want no better sport
” sometimeswhen at leisure he amused himself all day in the woods with a pocketpistol firing salutes to himself at regular intervals as he walked
inthe winter he had a fire by which at noon he warmed his coffee in akettle and as he sat on a log to eat his dinner the chickadees wouldsometimes come round and alight on his arm and peck at the potato inhis fingers and he said that he “liked to have the little _fellers_about him
”in him the animal man chiefly was developed
in physical endurance andcontentment he was cousin to the pine and the rock
i asked him once ifhe was not sometimes tired at night after working all day and heanswered with a sincere and serious look “gorrappit i never wastired in my life
” but the intellectual and what is called spiritualman in him were slumbering as in an infant
he had been instructed onlyin that innocent and ineffectual way in which the catholic prieststeach the aborigines by which the pupil is never educated to thedegree of consciousness but only to the degree of trust and reverenceand a child is not made a man but kept a child
when nature made himshe gave him a strong body and contentment for his portion and proppedhim on every side with reverence and reliance that he might live outhis threescore years and ten a child
he was so genuine andunsophisticated that no introduction would serve to introduce him morethan if you introduced a woodchuck to your neighbor
he had got to findhim out as you did
he would not play any part
men paid him wages forwork and so helped to feed and clothe him but he never exchangedopinions with them
he was so simply and naturally humble—if he can becalled humble who never aspires—that humility was no distinct qualityin him nor could he conceive of it
wiser men were demigods to him
ifyou told him that such a one was coming he did as if he thought thatany thing so grand would expect nothing of himself but take all theresponsibility on itself and let him be forgotten still
he neverheard the sound of praise
he particularly reverenced the writer andthe preacher
their performances were miracles
when i told him that iwrote considerably he thought for a long time that it was merely thehandwriting which i meant for he could write a remarkably good handhimself
i sometimes found the name of his native parish handsomelywritten in the snow by the highway with the proper french accent andknew that he had passed
i asked him if he ever wished to write histhoughts
he said that he had read and written letters for those whocould not but he never tried to write thoughts—no he could not hecould not tell what to put first it would kill him and then there wasspelling to be attended to at the same time
i heard that a distinguished wise man and reformer asked him if he didnot want the world to be changed but he answered with a chuckle ofsurprise in his canadian accent not knowing that the question had everbeen entertained before “no i like it well enough
” it would havesuggested many things to a philosopher to have dealings with him
to astranger he appeared to know nothing of things in general yet isometimes saw in him a man whom i had not seen before and i did notknow whether he was as wise as shakespeare or as simply ignorant as achild whether to suspect him of a fine poetic consciousness or ofstupidity
a townsman told me that when he met him sauntering throughthe village in his small close-fitting cap and whistling to himselfhe reminded him of a prince in disguise
his only books were an almanac and an arithmetic in which last he wasconsiderably expert
the former was a sort of cyclopædia to him whichhe supposed to contain an abstract of human knowledge as indeed itdoes to a considerable extent
i loved to sound him on the variousreforms of the day and he never failed to look at them in the mostsimple and practical light
he had never heard of such things before
could he do without factories
i asked
he had worn the home-madevermont gray he said and that was good
could he dispense with teaand coffee
did this country afford any beverage beside water
he hadsoaked hemlock leaves in water and drank it and thought that wasbetter than water in warm weather
when i asked him if he could dowithout money he showed the convenience of money in such a way as tosuggest and coincide with the most philosophical accounts of the originof this institution and the very derivation of the word _pecunia_
ifan ox were his property and he wished to get needles and thread at thestore he thought it would be inconvenient and impossible soon to go onmortgaging some portion of the creature each time to that amount
hecould defend many institutions better than any philosopher because indescribing them as they concerned him he gave the true reason fortheir prevalence and speculation had not suggested to him any other
at another time hearing plato’s definition of a man—a biped withoutfeathers—and that one exhibited a cock plucked and called it plato’sman he thought it an important difference that the _knees_ bent thewrong way
he would sometimes exclaim “how i love to talk
by georgei could talk all day
” i asked him once when i had not seen him formany months if he had got a new idea this summer
“good lord” saidhe “a man that has to work as i do if he does not forget the ideas hehas had he will do well
may be the man you hoe with is inclined torace then by gorry your mind must be there you think of weeds
” hewould sometimes ask me first on such occasions if i had made anyimprovement
one winter day i asked him if he was always satisfied withhimself wishing to suggest a substitute within him for the priestwithout and some higher motive for living
“satisfied
” said he “somemen are satisfied with one thing and some with another
one manperhaps if he has got enough will be satisfied to sit all day withhis back to the fire and his belly to the table by george
” yet inever by any manœuvring could get him to take the spiritual view ofthings the highest that he appeared to conceive of was a simpleexpediency such as you might expect an animal to appreciate and thispractically is true of most men
if i suggested any improvement in hismode of life he merely answered without expressing any regret thatit was too late
yet he thoroughly believed in honesty and the likevirtues
there was a certain positive originality however slight to bedetected in him and i occasionally observed that he was thinking forhimself and expressing his own opinion a phenomenon so rare that iwould any day walk ten miles to observe it and it amounted to there-origination of many of the institutions of society
though hehesitated and perhaps failed to express himself distinctly he alwayshad a presentable thought behind
yet his thinking was so primitive andimmersed in his animal life that though more promising than a merelylearned man’s it rarely ripened to any thing which can be reported
hesuggested that there might be men of genius in the lowest grades oflife however permanently humble and illiterate who take their ownview always or do not pretend to see at all who are as bottomlesseven as walden pond was thought to be though they may be dark andmuddy
many a traveller came out of his way to see me and the inside of myhouse and as an excuse for calling asked for a glass of water
itold them that i drank at the pond and pointed thither offering tolend them a dipper
far off as i lived i was not exempted from theannual visitation which occurs methinks about the first of aprilwhen every body is on the move and i had my share of good luck thoughthere were some curious specimens among my visitors
half-witted menfrom the almshouse and elsewhere came to see me but i endeavored tomake them exercise all the wit they had and make their confessions tome in such cases making wit the theme of our conversation and so wascompensated
indeed i found some of them to be wiser than the socalled _overseers_ of the poor and selectmen of the town and thoughtit was time that the tables were turned
with respect to wit i learnedthat there was not much difference between the half and the whole
oneday in particular an inoffensive simple-minded pauper whom withothers i had often seen used as fencing stuff standing or sitting on abushel in the fields to keep cattle and himself from straying visitedme and expressed a wish to live as i did
he told me with the utmostsimplicity and truth quite superior or rather _inferior_ to anything that is called humility that he was “deficient in intellect
”these were his words
the lord had made him so yet he supposed thelord cared as much for him as for another
“i have always been so”said he “from my childhood i never had much mind i was not likeother children i am weak in the head
it was the lord’s will isuppose
” and there he was to prove the truth of his words
he was ametaphysical puzzle to me
i have rarely met a fellow-man on suchpromising ground—it was so simple and sincere and so true all that hesaid
and true enough in proportion as he appeared to humble himselfwas he exalted
i did not know at first but it was the result of a wisepolicy
it seemed that from such a basis of truth and frankness as thepoor weak-headed pauper had laid our intercourse might go forward tosomething better than the intercourse of sages
i had some guests from those not reckoned commonly among the town’spoor but who should be who are among the world’s poor at any rateguests who appeal not to your hospitality but to your_hospitalality_ who earnestly wish to be helped and preface theirappeal with the information that they are resolved for one thingnever to help themselves
i require of a visitor that he be notactually starving though he may have the very best appetite in theworld however he got it
objects of charity are not guests
men whodid not know when their visit had terminated though i went about mybusiness again answering them from greater and greater remoteness
menof almost every degree of wit called on me in the migrating season
some who had more wits than they knew what to do with runaway slaveswith plantation manners who listened from time to time like the foxin the fable as if they heard the hounds a-baying on their track andlooked at me beseechingly as much as to say—     “o christian will you send me back
”one real runaway slave among the rest whom i helped to forward towardthe northstar
men of one idea like a hen with one chicken and that aduckling men of a thousand ideas and unkempt heads like those henswhich are made to take charge of a hundred chickens all in pursuit ofone bug a score of them lost in every morning’s dew—and becomefrizzled and mangy in consequence men of ideas instead of legs a sortof intellectual centipede that made you crawl all over
one manproposed a book in which visitors should write their names as at thewhite mountains but alas
i have too good a memory to make thatnecessary
i could not but notice some of the peculiarities of my visitors
girlsand boys and young women generally seemed glad to be in the woods
theylooked in the pond and at the flowers and improved their time
men ofbusiness even farmers thought only of solitude and employment and ofthe great distance at which i dwelt from something or other and thoughthey said that they loved a ramble in the woods occasionally it wasobvious that they did not
restless committed men whose time was alltaken up in getting a living or keeping it ministers who spoke of godas if they enjoyed a monopoly of the subject who could not bear allkinds of opinions doctors lawyers uneasy housekeepers who pried intomy cupboard and bed when i was out—how came mrs
—— to know that mysheets were not as clean as hers
—young men who had ceased to be youngand had concluded that it was safest to follow the beaten track of theprofessions—all these generally said that it was not possible to do somuch good in my position
ay
there was the rub
the old and infirm andthe timid of whatever age or sex thought most of sickness and suddenaccident and death to them life seemed full of danger—what danger isthere if you don’t think of any
—and they thought that a prudent manwould carefully select the safest position where dr
b
might be onhand at a moment’s warning
to them the village was literally a_com-munity_ a league for mutual defence and you would suppose thatthey would not go a-huckleberrying without a medicine chest
the amountof it is if a man is alive there is always _danger_ that he may diethough the danger must be allowed to be less in proportion as he isdead-and-alive to begin with
a man sits as many risks as he runs
finally there were the self-styled reformers the greatest bores ofall who thought that i was forever singing—     this is the house that i built     this is the man that lives in the house that i builtbut they did not know that the third line was—     these are the folks that worry the man     that lives in the house that i built
i did not fear the hen-harriers for i kept no chickens but i fearedthe men-harriers rather
i had more cheering visitors than the last
children come a-berryingrailroad men taking a sunday morning walk in clean shirts fishermenand hunters poets and philosophers in short all honest pilgrims whocame out to the woods for freedom’s sake and really left the villagebehind i was ready to greet with—“welcome englishmen
welcomeenglishmen
” for i had had communication with that race
the bean-fieldmeanwhile my beans the length of whose rows added together was sevenmiles already planted were impatient to be hoed for the earliest hadgrown considerably before the latest were in the ground indeed theywere not easily to be put off
what was the meaning of this so steadyand self-respecting this small herculean labor i knew not
i came tolove my rows my beans though so many more than i wanted
theyattached me to the earth and so i got strength like antæus
but whyshould i raise them
only heaven knows
this was my curious labor allsummer—to make this portion of the earth’s surface which had yieldedonly cinquefoil blackberries johnswort and the like before sweetwild fruits and pleasant flowers produce instead this pulse
whatshall i learn of beans or beans of me
i cherish them i hoe themearly and late i have an eye to them and this is my day’s work
it isa fine broad leaf to look on
my auxiliaries are the dews and rainswhich water this dry soil and what fertility is in the soil itselfwhich for the most part is lean and effete
my enemies are worms cooldays and most of all woodchucks
the last have nibbled for me aquarter of an acre clean
but what right had i to oust johnswort andthe rest and break up their ancient herb garden
soon however theremaining beans will be too tough for them and go forward to meet newfoes
when i was four years old as i well remember i was brought fromboston to this my native town through these very woods and this fieldto the pond
it is one of the oldest scenes stamped on my memory
andnow to-night my flute has waked the echoes over that very water
thepines still stand here older than i or if some have fallen i havecooked my supper with their stumps and a new growth is rising allaround preparing another aspect for new infant eyes
almost the samejohnswort springs from the same perennial root in this pasture andeven i have at length helped to clothe that fabulous landscape of myinfant dreams and one of the results of my presence and influence isseen in these bean leaves corn blades and potato vines
i planted about two acres and a half of upland and as it was onlyabout fifteen years since the land was cleared and i myself had gotout two or three cords of stumps i did not give it any manure but inthe course of the summer it appeared by the arrowheads which i turnedup in hoeing that an extinct nation had anciently dwelt here andplanted corn and beans ere white men came to clear the land and so tosome extent had exhausted the soil for this very crop
before yet any woodchuck or squirrel had run across the road or thesun had got above the shrub oaks while all the dew was on though thefarmers warned me against it—i would advise you to do all your work ifpossible while the dew is on—i began to level the ranks of haughtyweeds in my bean-field and throw dust upon their heads
early in themorning i worked barefooted dabbling like a plastic artist in the dewyand crumbling sand but later in the day the sun blistered my feet
there the sun lighted me to hoe beans pacing slowly backward andforward over that yellow gravelly upland between the long green rowsfifteen rods the one end terminating in a shrub oak copse where icould rest in the shade the other in a blackberry field where thegreen berries deepened their tints by the time i had made another bout
removing the weeds putting fresh soil about the bean stems andencouraging this weed which i had sown making the yellow soil expressits summer thought in bean leaves and blossoms rather than in wormwoodand piper and millet grass making the earth say beans instead ofgrass—this was my daily work
as i had little aid from horses orcattle or hired men or boys or improved implements of husbandry iwas much slower and became much more intimate with my beans thanusual
but labor of the hands even when pursued to the verge ofdrudgery is perhaps never the worst form of idleness
it has aconstant and imperishable moral and to the scholar it yields a classicresult
a very _agricola laboriosus_ was i to travellers bound westwardthrough lincoln and wayland to nobody knows where they sitting attheir ease in gigs with elbows on knees and reins loosely hanging infestoons i the home-staying laborious native of the soil
but soon myhomestead was out of their sight and thought
it was the only open andcultivated field for a great distance on either side of the road sothey made the most of it and sometimes the man in the field heard moreof travellers’ gossip and comment than was meant for his ear “beans solate
peas so late
”—for i continued to plant when others had begun tohoe—the ministerial husbandman had not suspected it
“corn my boyfor fodder corn for fodder
” “does he _live_ there
” asks the blackbonnet of the gray coat and the hard-featured farmer reins up hisgrateful dobbin to inquire what you are doing where he sees no manurein the furrow and recommends a little chip dirt or any little wastestuff or it may be ashes or plaster
but here were two acres and ahalf of furrows and only a hoe for cart and two hands to drawit—there being an aversion to other carts and horses—and chip dirtfar away
fellow-travellers as they rattled by compared it aloud withthe fields which they had passed so that i came to know how i stood inthe agricultural world
this was one field not in mr
coleman’s report
and by the way who estimates the value of the crop which natureyields in the still wilder fields unimproved by man
the crop of_english_ hay is carefully weighed the moisture calculated thesilicates and the potash but in all dells and pond holes in the woodsand pastures and swamps grows a rich and various crop only unreaped byman
mine was as it were the connecting link between wild andcultivated fields as some states are civilized and othershalf-civilized and others savage or barbarous so my field was thoughnot in a bad sense a half-cultivated field
they were beans cheerfullyreturning to their wild and primitive state that i cultivated and myhoe played the _ranz des vaches_ for them
near at hand upon the topmost spray of a birch sings thebrown-thrasher—or red mavis as some love to call him—all the morningglad of your society that would find out another farmer’s field ifyours were not here
while you are planting the seed he cries—“dropit drop it—cover it up cover it up—pull it up pull it up pull itup
” but this was not corn and so it was safe from such enemies as he
you may wonder what his rigmarole his amateur paganini performances onone string or on twenty have to do with your planting and yet preferit to leached ashes or plaster
it was a cheap sort of top dressing inwhich i had entire faith
as i drew a still fresher soil about the rows with my hoe i disturbedthe ashes of unchronicled nations who in primeval years lived underthese heavens and their small implements of war and hunting werebrought to the light of this modern day
they lay mingled with othernatural stones some of which bore the marks of having been burned byindian fires and some by the sun and also bits of pottery and glassbrought hither by the recent cultivators of the soil
when my hoetinkled against the stones that music echoed to the woods and the skyand was an accompaniment to my labor which yielded an instant andimmeasurable crop
it was no longer beans that i hoed nor i that hoedbeans and i remembered with as much pity as pride if i remembered atall my acquaintances who had gone to the city to attend the oratorios
the night-hawk circled overhead in the sunny afternoons—for i sometimesmade a day of it—like a mote in the eye or in heaven’s eye fallingfrom time to time with a swoop and a sound as if the heavens were renttorn at last to very rags and tatters and yet a seamless coperemained small imps that fill the air and lay their eggs on the groundon bare sand or rocks on the tops of hills where few have found themgraceful and slender like ripples caught up from the pond as leavesare raised by the wind to float in the heavens such kindredship is innature
the hawk is aerial brother of the wave which he sails over andsurveys those his perfect air-inflated wings answering to theelemental unfledged pinions of the sea
or sometimes i watched a pairof hen-hawks circling high in the sky alternately soaring anddescending approaching and leaving one another as if they were theembodiment of my own thoughts
or i was attracted by the passage ofwild pigeons from this wood to that with a slight quivering winnowingsound and carrier haste or from under a rotten stump my hoe turned upa sluggish portentous and outlandish spotted salamander a trace ofegypt and the nile yet our contemporary
when i paused to lean on myhoe these sounds and sights i heard and saw anywhere in the row apart of the inexhaustible entertainment which the country offers
on gala days the town fires its great guns which echo like popguns tothese woods and some waifs of martial music occasionally penetratethus far
to me away there in my bean-field at the other end of thetown the big guns sounded as if a puffball had burst and when therewas a military turnout of which i was ignorant i have sometimes had avague sense all the day of some sort of itching and disease in thehorizon as if some eruption would break out there soon eitherscarlatina or canker-rash until at length some more favorable puff ofwind making haste over the fields and up the wayland road brought meinformation of the “trainers
” it seemed by the distant hum as ifsomebody’s bees had swarmed and that the neighbors according tovirgil’s advice by a faint _tintinnabulum_ upon the most sonorous oftheir domestic utensils were endeavoring to call them down into thehive again
and when the sound died quite away and the hum had ceasedand the most favorable breezes told no tale i knew that they had gotthe last drone of them all safely into the middlesex hive and that nowtheir minds were bent on the honey with which it was smeared
i felt proud to know that the liberties of massachusetts and of ourfatherland were in such safe keeping and as i turned to my hoeingagain i was filled with an inexpressible confidence and pursued mylabor cheerfully with a calm trust in the future
when there were several bands of musicians it sounded as if all thevillage was a vast bellows and all the buildings expanded andcollapsed alternately with a din
but sometimes it was a really nobleand inspiring strain that reached these woods and the trumpet thatsings of fame and i felt as if i could spit a mexican with a goodrelish—for why should we always stand for trifles
—and looked roundfor a woodchuck or a skunk to exercise my chivalry upon
these martialstrains seemed as far away as palestine and reminded me of a march ofcrusaders in the horizon with a slight tantivy and tremulous motion ofthe elm-tree tops which overhang the village
this was one of the_great_ days though the sky had from my clearing only the sameeverlastingly great look that it wears daily and i saw no differencein it
it was a singular experience that long acquaintance which i cultivatedwith beans what with planting and hoeing and harvesting andthreshing and picking over and selling them—the last was the hardestof all—i might add eating for i did taste
i was determined to knowbeans
when they were growing i used to hoe from five o’clock in themorning till noon and commonly spent the rest of the day about otheraffairs
consider the intimate and curious acquaintance one makes withvarious kinds of weeds—it will bear some iteration in the account forthere was no little iteration in the labor—disturbing their delicateorganizations so ruthlessly and making such invidious distinctionswith his hoe levelling whole ranks of one species and sedulouslycultivating another
that’s roman wormwood—that’s pigweed—that’ssorrel—that’s piper-grass—have at him chop him up turn his rootsupward to the sun don’t let him have a fibre in the shade if you dohe’ll turn himself t’other side up and be as green as a leek in twodays
a long war not with cranes but with weeds those trojans whohad sun and rain and dews on their side
daily the beans saw me come totheir rescue armed with a hoe and thin the ranks of their enemiesfilling up the trenches with weedy dead
many a lusty crest-wavinghector that towered a whole foot above his crowding comrades fellbefore my weapon and rolled in the dust
those summer days which some of my contemporaries devoted to the finearts in boston or rome and others to contemplation in india andothers to trade in london or new york i thus with the other farmersof new england devoted to husbandry
not that i wanted beans to eatfor i am by nature a pythagorean so far as beans are concernedwhether they mean porridge or voting and exchanged them for rice butperchance as some must work in fields if only for the sake of tropesand expression to serve a parable-maker one day
it was on the whole arare amusement which continued too long might have become adissipation
though i gave them no manure and did not hoe them allonce i hoed them unusually well as far as i went and was paid for itin the end “there being in truth” as evelyn says “no compost orlætation whatsoever comparable to this continual motion repastinationand turning of the mould with the spade
” “the earth” he addselsewhere “especially if fresh has a certain magnetism in it bywhich it attracts the salt power or virtue (call it either) whichgives it life and is the logic of all the labor and stir we keep aboutit to sustain us all dungings and other sordid temperings being butthe vicars succedaneous to this improvement
” moreover this being oneof those “worn-out and exhausted lay fields which enjoy their sabbath”had perchance as sir kenelm digby thinks likely attracted “vitalspirits” from the air
i harvested twelve bushels of beans
but to be more particular for it is complained that mr

this is the result of my experience in raising beans
plant the commonsmall white bush bean about the first of june in rows three feet byeighteen inches apart being careful to select fresh round and unmixedseed
first look out for worms and supply vacancies by planting anew
then look out for woodchucks if it is an exposed place for they willnibble off the earliest tender leaves almost clean as they go andagain when the young tendrils make their appearance they have noticeof it and will shear them off with both buds and young pods sittingerect like a squirrel
but above all harvest as early as possible ifyou would escape frosts and have a fair and salable crop you may savemuch loss by this means
this further experience also i gained
i said to myself i will notplant beans and corn with so much industry another summer but suchseeds if the seed is not lost as sincerity truth simplicity faithinnocence and the like and see if they will not grow in this soileven with less toil and manurance and sustain me for surely it hasnot been exhausted for these crops
alas
i said this to myself butnow another summer is gone and another and another and i am obligedto say to you reader that the seeds which i planted if indeed they_were_ the seeds of those virtues were wormeaten or had lost theirvitality and so did not come up
commonly men will only be brave astheir fathers were brave or timid
this generation is very sure toplant corn and beans each new year precisely as the indians didcenturies ago and taught the first settlers to do as if there were afate in it
i saw an old man the other day to my astonishment makingthe holes with a hoe for the seventieth time at least and not forhimself to lie down in
but why should not the new englander try newadventures and not lay so much stress on his grain his potato andgrass crop and his orchards—raise other crops than these
why concernourselves so much about our beans for seed and not be concerned at allabout a new generation of men
we should really be fed and cheered ifwhen we met a man we were sure to see that some of the qualities whichi have named which we all prize more than those other productions butwhich are for the most part broadcast and floating in the air hadtaken root and grown in him
here comes such a subtile and ineffablequality for instance as truth or justice though the slightest amountor new variety of it along the road
our ambassadors should beinstructed to send home such seeds as these and congress help todistribute them over all the land
we should never stand upon ceremonywith sincerity
we should never cheat and insult and banish one anotherby our meanness if there were present the kernel of worth andfriendliness
we should not meet thus in haste
most men i do not meetat all for they seem not to have time they are busy about theirbeans
we would not deal with a man thus plodding ever leaning on ahoe or a spade as a staff between his work not as a mushroom butpartially risen out of the earth something more than erect likeswallows alighted and walking on the ground—     “and as he spake his wings would now and then     spread as he meant to fly then close again”so that we should suspect that we might be conversing with an angel
bread may not always nourish us but it always does us good it eventakes stiffness out of our joints and makes us supple and buoyantwhen we knew not what ailed us to recognize any generosity in man ornature to share any unmixed and heroic joy
ancient poetry and mythology suggest at least that husbandry was oncea sacred art but it is pursued with irreverent haste and heedlessnessby us our object being to have large farms and large crops merely
wehave no festival nor procession nor ceremony not excepting ourcattle-shows and so called thanksgivings by which the farmer expressesa sense of the sacredness of his calling or is reminded of its sacredorigin
it is the premium and the feast which tempt him
he sacrificesnot to ceres and the terrestrial jove but to the infernal plutusrather
by avarice and selfishness and a grovelling habit from whichnone of us is free of regarding the soil as property or the means ofacquiring property chiefly the landscape is deformed husbandry isdegraded with us and the farmer leads the meanest of lives
he knowsnature but as a robber
cato says that the profits of agriculture areparticularly pious or just (_maximeque pius quæstus_) and accordingto varro the old romans “called the same earth mother and ceres andthought that they who cultivated it led a pious and useful life andthat they alone were left of the race of king saturn
”we are wont to forget that the sun looks on our cultivated fields andon the prairies and forests without distinction
they all reflect andabsorb his rays alike and the former make but a small part of theglorious picture which he beholds in his daily course
in his view theearth is all equally cultivated like a garden
therefore we shouldreceive the benefit of his light and heat with a corresponding trustand magnanimity
what though i value the seed of these beans andharvest that in the fall of the year
this broad field which i havelooked at so long looks not to me as the principal cultivator but awayfrom me to influences more genial to it which water and make it green
these beans have results which are not harvested by me
do they notgrow for woodchucks partly
the ear of wheat (in latin _spica_obsoletely _speca_ from _spe_ hope) should not be the only hope ofthe husbandman its kernel or grain (_granum_ from _gerendo_ bearing)is not all that it bears
how then can our harvest fail
shall i notrejoice also at the abundance of the weeds whose seeds are the granaryof the birds
it matters little comparatively whether the fields fillthe farmer’s barns
the true husbandman will cease from anxiety as thesquirrels manifest no concern whether the woods will bear chestnutsthis year or not and finish his labor with every day relinquishingall claim to the produce of his fields and sacrificing in his mind notonly his first but his last fruits also
the villageafter hoeing or perhaps reading and writing in the forenoon iusually bathed again in the pond swimming across one of its coves fora stint and washed the dust of labor from my person or smoothed outthe last wrinkle which study had made and for the afternoon wasabsolutely free
every day or two i strolled to the village to hearsome of the gossip which is incessantly going on there circulatingeither from mouth to mouth or from newspaper to newspaper and whichtaken in homœopathic doses was really as refreshing in its way as therustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs
as i walked in the woods tosee the birds and squirrels so i walked in the village to see the menand boys instead of the wind among the pines i heard the carts rattle
in one direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in theriver meadows under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the otherhorizon was a village of busy men as curious to me as if they had beenprairie dogs each sitting at the mouth of its burrow or running overto a neighbor’s to gossip
i went there frequently to observe theirhabits
the village appeared to me a great news room and on one sideto support it as once at redding & company’s on state street theykept nuts and raisins or salt and meal and other groceries
some havesuch a vast appetite for the former commodity that is the news andsuch sound digestive organs that they can sit forever in publicavenues without stirring and let it simmer and whisper through themlike the etesian winds or as if inhaling ether it only producingnumbness and insensibility to pain—otherwise it would often be painfulto hear—without affecting the consciousness
i hardly ever failedwhen i rambled through the village to see a row of such worthieseither sitting on a ladder sunning themselves with their bodiesinclined forward and their eyes glancing along the line this way andthat from time to time with a voluptuous expression or else leaningagainst a barn with their hands in their pockets like caryatides asif to prop it up
they being commonly out of doors heard whatever wasin the wind
these are the coarsest mills in which all gossip is firstrudely digested or cracked up before it is emptied into finer and moredelicate hoppers within doors
i observed that the vitals of thevillage were the grocery the bar-room the post-office and the bankand as a necessary part of the machinery they kept a bell a big gunand a fire-engine at convenient places and the houses were soarranged as to make the most of mankind in lanes and fronting oneanother so that every traveller had to run the gantlet and every manwoman and child might get a lick at him
of course those who werestationed nearest to the head of the line where they could most seeand be seen and have the first blow at him paid the highest pricesfor their places and the few straggling inhabitants in the outskirtswhere long gaps in the line began to occur and the traveller could getover walls or turn aside into cow paths and so escape paid a veryslight ground or window tax
signs were hung out on all sides to allurehim some to catch him by the appetite as the tavern and victuallingcellar some by the fancy as the dry goods store and the jeweller’sand others by the hair or the feet or the skirts as the barber theshoemaker or the tailor
besides there was a still more terriblestanding invitation to call at every one of these houses and companyexpected about these times
for the most part i escaped wonderfullyfrom these dangers either by proceeding at once boldly and withoutdeliberation to the goal as is recommended to those who run thegantlet or by keeping my thoughts on high things like orpheus who“loudly singing the praises of the gods to his lyre drowned the voicesof the sirens and kept out of danger
” sometimes i bolted suddenlyand nobody could tell my whereabouts for i did not stand much aboutgracefulness and never hesitated at a gap in a fence
i was evenaccustomed to make an irruption into some houses where i was wellentertained and after learning the kernels and very last sieve-ful ofnews what had subsided the prospects of war and peace and whetherthe world was likely to hold together much longer i was let outthrough the rear avenues and so escaped to the woods again
it was very pleasant when i stayed late in town to launch myself intothe night especially if it was dark and tempestuous and set sail fromsome bright village parlor or lecture room with a bag of rye or indianmeal upon my shoulder for my snug harbor in the woods having made alltight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry crew ofthoughts leaving only my outer man at the helm or even tying up thehelm when it was plain sailing
i had many a genial thought by thecabin fire “as i sailed
” i was never cast away nor distressed in anyweather though i encountered some severe storms
it is darker in thewoods even in common nights than most suppose
i frequently had tolook up at the opening between the trees above the path in order tolearn my route and where there was no cart-path to feel with my feetthe faint track which i had worn or steer by the known relation ofparticular trees which i felt with my hands passing between two pinesfor instance not more than eighteen inches apart in the midst of thewoods invariably in the darkest night
sometimes after coming homethus late in a dark and muggy night when my feet felt the path whichmy eyes could not see dreaming and absent-minded all the way until iwas aroused by having to raise my hand to lift the latch i have notbeen able to recall a single step of my walk and i have thought thatperhaps my body would find its way home if its master should forsakeit as the hand finds its way to the mouth without assistance
severaltimes when a visitor chanced to stay into evening and it proved adark night i was obliged to conduct him to the cart-path in the rearof the house and then point out to him the direction he was to pursueand in keeping which he was to be guided rather by his feet than hiseyes
one very dark night i directed thus on their way two young menwho had been fishing in the pond
they lived about a mile off throughthe woods and were quite used to the route
a day or two after one ofthem told me that they wandered about the greater part of the nightclose by their own premises and did not get home till toward morningby which time as there had been several heavy showers in the meanwhile and the leaves were very wet they were drenched to their skins
i have heard of many going astray even in the village streets when thedarkness was so thick that you could cut it with a knife as the sayingis
some who live in the outskirts having come to town a-shopping intheir wagons have been obliged to put up for the night and gentlemenand ladies making a call have gone half a mile out of their wayfeeling the sidewalk only with their feet and not knowing when theyturned
it is a surprising and memorable as well as valuableexperience to be lost in the woods any time
often in a snow stormeven by day one will come out upon a well-known road and yet find itimpossible to tell which way leads to the village
though he knows thathe has travelled it a thousand times he cannot recognize a feature init but it is as strange to him as if it were a road in siberia
bynight of course the perplexity is infinitely greater
in our mosttrivial walks we are constantly though unconsciously steering likepilots by certain well-known beacons and headlands and if we go beyondour usual course we still carry in our minds the bearing of someneighboring cape and not till we are completely lost or turnedround—for a man needs only to be turned round once with his eyes shutin this world to be lost—do we appreciate the vastness and strangenessof nature
every man has to learn the points of compass again as oftenas he awakes whether from sleep or any abstraction
not till we arelost in other words not till we have lost the world do we begin tofind ourselves and realize where we are and the infinite extent of ourrelations
one afternoon near the end of the first summer when i went to thevillage to get a shoe from the cobbler’s i was seized and put intojail because as i have elsewhere related i did not pay a tax to orrecognize the authority of the state which buys and sells men womenand children like cattle at the door of its senate-house
i had gonedown to the woods for other purposes
but wherever a man goes menwill pursue and paw him with their dirty institutions and if theycan constrain him to belong to their desperate odd-fellow society
itis true i might have resisted forcibly with more or less effect mighthave run “amok” against society but i preferred that society shouldrun “amok” against me it being the desperate party
however i wasreleased the next day obtained my mended shoe and returned to thewoods in season to get my dinner of huckleberries on fair-haven hill
iwas never molested by any person but those who represented the state
ihad no lock nor bolt but for the desk which held my papers not even anail to put over my latch or windows
i never fastened my door night orday though i was to be absent several days not even when the nextfall i spent a fortnight in the woods of maine
and yet my house wasmore respected than if it had been surrounded by a file of soldiers
the tired rambler could rest and warm himself by my fire the literaryamuse himself with the few books on my table or the curious byopening my closet door see what was left of my dinner and whatprospect i had of a supper
yet though many people of every class camethis way to the pond i suffered no serious inconvenience from thesesources and i never missed anything but one small book a volume ofhomer which perhaps was improperly gilded and this i trust a soldierof our camp has found by this time
i am convinced that if all menwere to live as simply as i then did thieving and robbery would beunknown
these take place only in communities where some have got morethan is sufficient while others have not enough
the pope’s homerswould soon get properly distributed
—                     “nec bella fuerunt     faginus astabat dum scyphus ante dapes
”                     “nor wars did men molest     when only beechen bowls were in request
”“you who govern public affairs what need have you to employpunishments
love virtue and the people will be virtuous
the virtuesof a superior man are like the wind the virtues of a common man arelike the grass the grass when the wind passes over it bends
”the pondssometimes having had a surfeit of human society and gossip and wornout all my village friends i rambled still farther westward than ihabitually dwell into yet more unfrequented parts of the town “tofresh woods and pastures new” or while the sun was setting made mysupper of huckleberries and blueberries on fair haven hill and laid upa store for several days
the fruits do not yield their true flavor tothe purchaser of them nor to him who raises them for the market
thereis but one way to obtain it yet few take that way
if you would knowthe flavor of huckleberries ask the cow-boy or the partridge
it is avulgar error to suppose that you have tasted huckleberries who neverplucked them
a huckleberry never reaches boston they have not beenknown there since they grew on her three hills
the ambrosial andessential part of the fruit is lost with the bloom which is rubbed offin the market cart and they become mere provender
as long as eternaljustice reigns not one innocent huckleberry can be transported thitherfrom the country’s hills
occasionally after my hoeing was done for the day i joined someimpatient companion who had been fishing on the pond since morning assilent and motionless as a duck or a floating leaf and afterpractising various kinds of philosophy had concluded commonly by thetime i arrived that he belonged to the ancient sect of cœnobites
there was one older man an excellent fisher and skilled in all kindsof woodcraft who was pleased to look upon my house as a buildingerected for the convenience of fishermen and i was equally pleasedwhen he sat in my doorway to arrange his lines
once in a while we sattogether on the pond he at one end of the boat and i at the otherbut not many words passed between us for he had grown deaf in hislater years but he occasionally hummed a psalm which harmonized wellenough with my philosophy
our intercourse was thus altogether one ofunbroken harmony far more pleasing to remember than if it had beencarried on by speech
when as was commonly the case i had none tocommune with i used to raise the echoes by striking with a paddle onthe side of my boat filling the surrounding woods with circling anddilating sound stirring them up as the keeper of a menagerie his wildbeasts until i elicited a growl from every wooded vale and hill-side
in warm evenings i frequently sat in the boat playing the flute andsaw the perch which i seemed to have charmed hovering around me andthe moon travelling over the ribbed bottom which was strewed with thewrecks of the forest
formerly i had come to this pond adventurouslyfrom time to time in dark summer nights with a companion and makinga fire close to the water’s edge which we thought attracted thefishes we caught pouts with a bunch of worms strung on a thread andwhen we had done far in the night threw the burning brands high intothe air like skyrockets which coming down into the pond werequenched with a loud hissing and we were suddenly groping in totaldarkness
through this whistling a tune we took our way to the hauntsof men again
but now i had made my home by the shore
sometimes after staying in a village parlor till the family had allretired i have returned to the woods and partly with a view to thenext day’s dinner spent the hours of midnight fishing from a boat bymoonlight serenaded by owls and foxes and hearing from time to timethe creaking note of some unknown bird close at hand
these experienceswere very memorable and valuable to me—anchored in forty feet ofwater and twenty or thirty rods from the shore surrounded sometimesby thousands of small perch and shiners dimpling the surface withtheir tails in the moonlight and communicating by a long flaxen linewith mysterious nocturnal fishes which had their dwelling forty feetbelow or sometimes dragging sixty feet of line about the pond as idrifted in the gentle night breeze now and then feeling a slightvibration along it indicative of some life prowling about itsextremity of dull uncertain blundering purpose there and slow to makeup its mind
at length you slowly raise pulling hand over hand somehorned pout squeaking and squirming to the upper air
it was veryqueer especially in dark nights when your thoughts had wandered tovast and cosmogonal themes in other spheres to feel this faint jerkwhich came to interrupt your dreams and link you to nature again
itseemed as if i might next cast my line upward into the air as well asdownward into this element which was scarcely more dense
thus icaught two fishes as it were with one hook
the scenery of walden is on a humble scale and though very beautifuldoes not approach to grandeur nor can it much concern one who has notlong frequented it or lived by its shore yet this pond is soremarkable for its depth and purity as to merit a particulardescription
it is a clear and deep green well half a mile long and amile and three quarters in circumference and contains about sixty-oneand a half acres a perennial spring in the midst of pine and oakwoods without any visible inlet or outlet except by the clouds andevaporation
the surrounding hills rise abruptly from the water to theheight of forty to eighty feet though on the south-east and east theyattain to about one hundred and one hundred and fifty feetrespectively within a quarter and a third of a mile
they areexclusively woodland
all our concord waters have two colors at leastone when viewed at a distance and another more proper close at hand
the first depends more on the light and follows the sky
in clearweather in summer they appear blue at a little distance especiallyif agitated and at a great distance all appear alike
in stormyweather they are sometimes of a dark slate color
the sea however issaid to be blue one day and green another without any perceptiblechange in the atmosphere
i have seen our river when the landscapebeing covered with snow both water and ice were almost as green asgrass
some consider blue “to be the color of pure water whetherliquid or solid
” but looking directly down into our waters from aboat they are seen to be of very different colors
walden is blue atone time and green at another even from the same point of view
lyingbetween the earth and the heavens it partakes of the color of both
viewed from a hill-top it reflects the color of the sky but near athand it is of a yellowish tint next the shore where you can see thesand then a light green which gradually deepens to a uniform darkgreen in the body of the pond
in some lights viewed even from ahill-top it is of a vivid green next the shore
some have referredthis to the reflection of the verdure but it is equally green thereagainst the railroad sand-bank and in the spring before the leavesare expanded and it may be simply the result of the prevailing bluemixed with the yellow of the sand
such is the color of its iris
thisis that portion also where in the spring the ice being warmed by theheat of the sun reflected from the bottom and also transmitted throughthe earth melts first and forms a narrow canal about the still frozenmiddle
like the rest of our waters when much agitated in clearweather so that the surface of the waves may reflect the sky at theright angle or because there is more light mixed with it it appearsat a little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself and at sucha time being on its surface and looking with divided vision so as tosee the reflection i have discerned a matchless and indescribablelight blue such as watered or changeable silks and sword bladessuggest more cerulean than the sky itself alternating with theoriginal dark green on the opposite sides of the waves which lastappeared but muddy in comparison
it is a vitreous greenish blue as iremember it like those patches of the winter sky seen through cloudvistas in the west before sundown
yet a single glass of its water heldup to the light is as colorless as an equal quantity of air
it is wellknown that a large plate of glass will have a green tint owing as themakers say to its “body” but a small piece of the same will becolorless
how large a body of walden water would be required toreflect a green tint i have never proved
the water of our river isblack or a very dark brown to one looking directly down on it andlike that of most ponds imparts to the body of one bathing in it ayellowish tinge but this water is of such crystalline purity that thebody of the bather appears of an alabaster whiteness still moreunnatural which as the limbs are magnified and distorted withalproduces a monstrous effect making fit studies for a michael angelo
the water is so transparent that the bottom can easily be discerned atthe depth of twenty-five or thirty feet
paddling over it you may seemany feet beneath the surface the schools of perch and shiners perhapsonly an inch long yet the former easily distinguished by theirtransverse bars and you think that they must be ascetic fish that finda subsistence there
once in the winter many years ago when i hadbeen cutting holes through the ice in order to catch pickerel as istepped ashore i tossed my axe back on to the ice but as if some evilgenius had directed it it slid four or five rods directly into one ofthe holes where the water was twenty-five feet deep
out of curiosityi lay down on the ice and looked through the hole until i saw the axea little on one side standing on its head with its helve erect andgently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond and there itmight have stood erect and swaying till in the course of time thehandle rotted off if i had not disturbed it
making another holedirectly over it with an ice chisel which i had and cutting down thelongest birch which i could find in the neighborhood with my knife imade a slip-noose which i attached to its end and letting it downcarefully passed it over the knob of the handle and drew it by a linealong the birch and so pulled the axe out again
the shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones likepaving stones excepting one or two short sand beaches and is so steepthat in many places a single leap will carry you into water over yourhead and were it not for its remarkable transparency that would bethe last to be seen of its bottom till it rose on the opposite side
some think it is bottomless
it is nowhere muddy and a casual observerwould say that there were no weeds at all in it and of noticeableplants except in the little meadows recently overflowed which do notproperly belong to it a closer scrutiny does not detect a flag nor abulrush nor even a lily yellow or white but only a few smallheart-leaves and potamogetons and perhaps a water-target or two allwhich however a bather might not perceive and these plants are cleanand bright like the element they grow in
the stones extend a rod ortwo into the water and then the bottom is pure sand except in thedeepest parts where there is usually a little sediment probably fromthe decay of the leaves which have been wafted on to it so manysuccessive falls and a bright green weed is brought up on anchors evenin midwinter
we have one other pond just like this white pond in nine acre cornerabout two and a half miles westerly but though i am acquainted withmost of the ponds within a dozen miles of this centre i do not know athird of this pure and well-like character
successive nationsperchance have drank at admired and fathomed it and passed away andstill its water is green and pellucid as ever
not an intermittingspring
perhaps on that spring morning when adam and eve were drivenout of eden walden pond was already in existence and even thenbreaking up in a gentle spring rain accompanied with mist and asoutherly wind and covered with myriads of ducks and geese which hadnot heard of the fall when still such pure lakes sufficed them
eventhen it had commenced to rise and fall and had clarified its watersand colored them of the hue they now wear and obtained a patent ofheaven to be the only walden pond in the world and distiller ofcelestial dews
who knows in how many unremembered nations’ literaturesthis has been the castalian fountain
or what nymphs presided over itin the golden age
it is a gem of the first water which concord wearsin her coronet
yet perchance the first who came to this well have left some trace oftheir footsteps
i have been surprised to detect encircling the pondeven where a thick wood has just been cut down on the shore a narrowshelf-like path in the steep hill-side alternately rising and fallingapproaching and receding from the water’s edge as old probably as therace of man here worn by the feet of aboriginal hunters and stillfrom time to time unwittingly trodden by the present occupants of theland
this is particularly distinct to one standing on the middle ofthe pond in winter just after a light snow has fallen appearing as aclear undulating white line unobscured by weeds and twigs and veryobvious a quarter of a mile off in many places where in summer it ishardly distinguishable close at hand
the snow reprints it as it werein clear white type alto-relievo
the ornamented grounds of villaswhich will one day be built here may still preserve some trace of this
the pond rises and falls but whether regularly or not and within whatperiod nobody knows though as usual many pretend to know
it iscommonly higher in the winter and lower in the summer though notcorresponding to the general wet and dryness
i can remember when itwas a foot or two lower and also when it was at least five feethigher than when i lived by it
there is a narrow sand-bar runninginto it with very deep water on one side on which i helped boil akettle of chowder some six rods from the main shore about the year1824 which it has not been possible to do for twenty-five years andon the other hand my friends used to listen with incredulity when itold them that a few years later i was accustomed to fish from a boatin a secluded cove in the woods fifteen rods from the only shore theyknew which place was long since converted into a meadow
but the pondhas risen steadily for two years and now in the summer of ’52 isjust five feet higher than when i lived there or as high as it wasthirty years ago and fishing goes on again in the meadow
this makes adifference of level at the outside of six or seven feet and yet thewater shed by the surrounding hills is insignificant in amount andthis overflow must be referred to causes which affect the deep springs
this same summer the pond has begun to fall again
it is remarkablethat this fluctuation whether periodical or not appears thus torequire many years for its accomplishment
i have observed one rise anda part of two falls and i expect that a dozen or fifteen years hencethe water will again be as low as i have ever known it
flint’s pond amile eastward allowing for the disturbance occasioned by its inletsand outlets and the smaller intermediate ponds also sympathize withwalden and recently attained their greatest height at the same timewith the latter
the same is true as far as my observation goes ofwhite pond
this rise and fall of walden at long intervals serves this use atleast the water standing at this great height for a year or morethough it makes it difficult to walk round it kills the shrubs andtrees which have sprung up about its edge since the last risepitch-pines birches alders aspens and others and falling againleaves an unobstructed shore for unlike many ponds and all waterswhich are subject to a daily tide its shore is cleanest when the wateris lowest
on the side of the pond next my house a row of pitch pinesfifteen feet high has been killed and tipped over as if by a lever andthus a stop put to their encroachments and their size indicates howmany years have elapsed since the last rise to this height
by thisfluctuation the pond asserts its title to a shore and thus the _shore_is _shorn_ and the trees cannot hold it by right of possession
theseare the lips of the lake on which no beard grows
it licks its chapsfrom time to time
when the water is at its height the alderswillows and maples send forth a mass of fibrous red roots several feetlong from all sides of their stems in the water and to the height ofthree or four feet from the ground in the effort to maintainthemselves and i have known the high-blueberry bushes about the shorewhich commonly produce no fruit bear an abundant crop under thesecircumstances
some have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly paved
my townsmen have all heard the tradition the oldest people tell methat they heard it in their youth that anciently the indians wereholding a pow-wow upon a hill here which rose as high into the heavensas the pond now sinks deep into the earth and they used muchprofanity as the story goes though this vice is one of which theindians were never guilty and while they were thus engaged the hillshook and suddenly sank and only one old squaw named walden escapedand from her the pond was named
it has been conjectured that when thehill shook these stones rolled down its side and became the presentshore
it is very certain at any rate that once there was no pondhere and now there is one and this indian fable does not in anyrespect conflict with the account of that ancient settler whom i havementioned who remembers so well when he first came here with hisdivining rod saw a thin vapor rising from the sward and the hazelpointed steadily downward and he concluded to dig a well here
as forthe stones many still think that they are hardly to be accounted forby the action of the waves on these hills but i observe that thesurrounding hills are remarkably full of the same kind of stones sothat they have been obliged to pile them up in walls on both sides ofthe railroad cut nearest the pond and moreover there are most stoneswhere the shore is most abrupt so that unfortunately it is no longera mystery to me
i detect the paver
if the name was not derived fromthat of some english locality—saffron walden for instance—one mightsuppose that it was called originally _walled-in_ pond
the pond was my well ready dug
for four months in the year its wateris as cold as it is pure at all times and i think that it is then asgood as any if not the best in the town
in the winter all waterwhich is exposed to the air is colder than springs and wells which areprotected from it
the temperature of the pond water which had stood inthe room where i sat from five o’clock in the afternoon till noon thenext day the sixth of march 1846 the thermometer having been up to65° or 70° some of the time owing partly to the sun on the roof was42° or one degree colder than the water of one of the coldest wells inthe village just drawn
the temperature of the boiling spring the sameday was 45° or the warmest of any water tried though it is thecoldest that i know of in summer when beside shallow and stagnantsurface water is not mingled with it
moreover in summer walden neverbecomes so warm as most water which is exposed to the sun on accountof its depth
in the warmest weather i usually placed a pailful in mycellar where it became cool in the night and remained so during theday though i also resorted to a spring in the neighborhood
it was asgood when a week old as the day it was dipped and had no taste of thepump
whoever camps for a week in summer by the shore of a pond needsonly bury a pail of water a few feet deep in the shade of his camp tobe independent of the luxury of ice
there have been caught in walden pickerel one weighing seven poundsto say nothing of another which carried off a reel with great velocitywhich the fisherman safely set down at eight pounds because he did notsee him perch and pouts some of each weighing over two poundsshiners chivins or roach (_leuciscus pulchellus_) a very few breamsand a couple of eels one weighing four pounds—i am thus particularbecause the weight of a fish is commonly its only title to fame andthese are the only eels i have heard of here—also i have a faintrecollection of a little fish some five inches long with silvery sidesand a greenish back somewhat dace-like in its character which imention here chiefly to link my facts to fable
nevertheless this pondis not very fertile in fish
its pickerel though not abundant are itschief boast
i have seen at one time lying on the ice pickerel of atleast three different kinds a long and shallow one steel-coloredmost like those caught in the river a bright golden kind withgreenish reflections and remarkably deep which is the most commonhere and another golden-colored and shaped like the last butpeppered on the sides with small dark brown or black spots intermixedwith a few faint blood-red ones very much like a trout
the specificname _reticulatus_ would not apply to this it should be _guttatus_rather
these are all very firm fish and weigh more than their sizepromises
the shiners pouts and perch also and indeed all the fisheswhich inhabit this pond are much cleaner handsomer and firmerfleshed than those in the river and most other ponds as the water ispurer and they can easily be distinguished from them
probably manyichthyologists would make new varieties of some of them
there are alsoa clean race of frogs and tortoises and a few muscels in it muskratsand minks leave their traces about it and occasionally a travellingmud-turtle visits it
sometimes when i pushed off my boat in themorning i disturbed a great mud-turtle which had secreted himselfunder the boat in the night
ducks and geese frequent it in the springand fall the white-bellied swallows (_hirundo bicolor_) skim over itand the peetweets (_totanus macularius_) “teter” along its stony shoresall summer
i have sometimes disturbed a fishhawk sitting on awhite-pine over the water but i doubt if it is ever profaned by thewing of a gull like fair haven
at most it tolerates one annual loon
these are all the animals of consequence which frequent it now
you may see from a boat in calm weather near the sandy eastern shorewhere the water is eight or ten feet deep and also in some other partsof the pond some circular heaps half a dozen feet in diameter by afoot in height consisting of small stones less than a hen’s egg insize where all around is bare sand
at first you wonder if the indianscould have formed them on the ice for any purpose and so when the icemelted they sank to the bottom but they are too regular and some ofthem plainly too fresh for that
they are similar to those found inrivers but as there are no suckers nor lampreys here i know not bywhat fish they could be made
perhaps they are the nests of the chivin
these lend a pleasing mystery to the bottom
the shore is irregular enough not to be monotonous
i have in my mind’seye the western indented with deep bays the bolder northern and thebeautifully scalloped southern shore where successive capes overlapeach other and suggest unexplored coves between
the forest has neverso good a setting nor is so distinctly beautiful as when seen fromthe middle of a small lake amid hills which rise from the water’s edgefor the water in which it is reflected not only makes the bestforeground in such a case but with its winding shore the mostnatural and agreeable boundary to it
there is no rawness norimperfection in its edge there as where the axe has cleared a part ora cultivated field abuts on it
the trees have ample room to expand onthe water side and each sends forth its most vigorous branch in thatdirection
there nature has woven a natural selvage and the eye risesby just gradations from the low shrubs of the shore to the highesttrees
there are few traces of man’s hand to be seen
the water lavesthe shore as it did a thousand years ago
a lake is the landscape’s most beautiful and expressive feature
it isearth’s eye looking into which the beholder measures the depth of hisown nature
the fluviatile trees next the shore are the slendereyelashes which fringe it and the wooded hills and cliffs around areits overhanging brows
standing on the smooth sandy beach at the east end of the pond in acalm september afternoon when a slight haze makes the opposite shoreline indistinct i have seen whence came the expression “the glassysurface of a lake
” when you invert your head it looks like a threadof finest gossamer stretched across the valley and gleaming againstthe distant pine woods separating one stratum of the atmosphere fromanother
you would think that you could walk dry under it to theopposite hills and that the swallows which skim over might perch onit
indeed they sometimes dive below this line as it were by mistakeand are undeceived
as you look over the pond westward you are obligedto employ both your hands to defend your eyes against the reflected aswell as the true sun for they are equally bright and if between thetwo you survey its surface critically it is literally as smooth asglass except where the skater insects at equal intervals scatteredover its whole extent by their motions in the sun produce the finestimaginable sparkle on it or perchance a duck plumes itself or as ihave said a swallow skims so low as to touch it
it may be that in thedistance a fish describes an arc of three or four feet in the air andthere is one bright flash where it emerges and another where itstrikes the water sometimes the whole silvery arc is revealed or hereand there perhaps is a thistle-down floating on its surface whichthe fishes dart at and so dimple it again
it is like molten glasscooled but not congealed and the few motes in it are pure andbeautiful like the imperfections in glass
you may often detect a yetsmoother and darker water separated from the rest as if by aninvisible cobweb boom of the water nymphs resting on it
from ahill-top you can see a fish leap in almost any part for not a pickerelor shiner picks an insect from this smooth surface but it manifestlydisturbs the equilibrium of the whole lake
it is wonderful with whatelaborateness this simple fact is advertised—this piscine murder willout—and from my distant perch i distinguish the circling undulationswhen they are half a dozen rods in diameter
you can even detect awater-bug (_gyrinus_) ceaselessly progressing over the smooth surface aquarter of a mile off for they furrow the water slightly making aconspicuous ripple bounded by two diverging lines but the skatersglide over it without rippling it perceptibly
when the surface isconsiderably agitated there are no skaters nor water-bugs on it butapparently in calm days they leave their havens and adventurouslyglide forth from the shore by short impulses till they completely coverit
it is a soothing employment on one of those fine days in the fallwhen all the warmth of the sun is fully appreciated to sit on a stumpon such a height as this overlooking the pond and study the dimplingcircles which are incessantly inscribed on its otherwise invisiblesurface amid the reflected skies and trees
over this great expansethere is no disturbance but it is thus at once gently smoothed away andassuaged as when a vase of water is jarred the trembling circlesseek the shore and all is smooth again
not a fish can leap or aninsect fall on the pond but it is thus reported in circling dimples inlines of beauty as it were the constant welling up of its fountainthe gentle pulsing of its life the heaving of its breast
the thrillsof joy and thrills of pain are undistinguishable
how peaceful thephenomena of the lake
again the works of man shine as in the spring
ay every leaf and twig and stone and cobweb sparkles now atmid-afternoon as when covered with dew in a spring morning
everymotion of an oar or an insect produces a flash of light and if an oarfalls how sweet the echo
in such a day in september or october walden is a perfect forestmirror set round with stones as precious to my eye as if fewer orrarer
nothing so fair so pure and at the same time so large as alake perchance lies on the surface of the earth
sky water
it needsno fence
nations come and go without defiling it
it is a mirror whichno stone can crack whose quicksilver will never wear off whosegilding nature continually repairs no storms no dust can dim itssurface ever fresh—a mirror in which all impurity presented to itsinks swept and dusted by the sun’s hazy brush—this the lightdust-cloth—which retains no breath that is breathed on it but sendsits own to float as clouds high above its surface and be reflected inits bosom still
a field of water betrays the spirit that is in the air
it iscontinually receiving new life and motion from above
it isintermediate in its nature between land and sky
on land only the grassand trees wave but the water itself is rippled by the wind
i seewhere the breeze dashes across it by the streaks or flakes of light
itis remarkable that we can look down on its surface
we shall perhapslook down thus on the surface of air at length and mark where a stillsubtler spirit sweeps over it
the skaters and water-bugs finally disappear in the latter part ofoctober when the severe frosts have come and then and in novemberusually in a calm day there is absolutely nothing to ripple thesurface
one november afternoon in the calm at the end of a rain stormof several days’ duration when the sky was still completely overcastand the air was full of mist i observed that the pond was remarkablysmooth so that it was difficult to distinguish its surface though itno longer reflected the bright tints of october but the sombrenovember colors of the surrounding hills
though i passed over it asgently as possible the slight undulations produced by my boat extendedalmost as far as i could see and gave a ribbed appearance to thereflections
but as i was looking over the surface i saw here andthere at a distance a faint glimmer as if some skater insects whichhad escaped the frosts might be collected there or perchance thesurface being so smooth betrayed where a spring welled up from thebottom
paddling gently to one of these places i was surprised to findmyself surrounded by myriads of small perch about five inches long ofa rich bronze color in the green water sporting there and constantlyrising to the surface and dimpling it sometimes leaving bubbles on it
in such transparent and seemingly bottomless water reflecting theclouds i seemed to be floating through the air as in a balloon andtheir swimming impressed me as a kind of flight or hovering as if theywere a compact flock of birds passing just beneath my level on theright or left their fins like sails set all around them
there weremany such schools in the pond apparently improving the short seasonbefore winter would draw an icy shutter over their broad skylightsometimes giving to the surface an appearance as if a slight breezestruck it or a few rain-drops fell there
when i approached carelesslyand alarmed them they made a sudden splash and rippling with theirtails as if one had struck the water with a brushy bough andinstantly took refuge in the depths
at length the wind rose the mistincreased and the waves began to run and the perch leaped much higherthan before half out of water a hundred black points three incheslong at once above the surface
even as late as the fifth of decemberone year i saw some dimples on the surface and thinking it was goingto rain hard immediately the air being full of mist i made haste totake my place at the oars and row homeward already the rain seemedrapidly increasing though i felt none on my cheek and i anticipated athorough soaking
but suddenly the dimples ceased for they wereproduced by the perch which the noise of my oars had seared into thedepths and i saw their schools dimly disappearing so i spent a dryafternoon after all
an old man who used to frequent this pond nearly sixty years ago whenit was dark with surrounding forests tells me that in those days hesometimes saw it all alive with ducks and other water fowl and thatthere were many eagles about it
he came here a-fishing and used anold log canoe which he found on the shore
it was made of twowhite-pine logs dug out and pinned together and was cut off square atthe ends
it was very clumsy but lasted a great many years before itbecame water-logged and perhaps sank to the bottom
he did not knowwhose it was it belonged to the pond
he used to make a cable for hisanchor of strips of hickory bark tied together
an old man a potterwho lived by the pond before the revolution told him once that therewas an iron chest at the bottom and that he had seen it
sometimes itwould come floating up to the shore but when you went toward it itwould go back into deep water and disappear
i was pleased to hear ofthe old log canoe which took the place of an indian one of the samematerial but more graceful construction which perchance had first beena tree on the bank and then as it were fell into the water to floatthere for a generation the most proper vessel for the lake
i rememberthat when i first looked into these depths there were many large trunksto be seen indistinctly lying on the bottom which had either beenblown over formerly or left on the ice at the last cutting when woodwas cheaper but now they have mostly disappeared
when i first paddled a boat on walden it was completely surrounded bythick and lofty pine and oak woods and in some of its coves grapevines had run over the trees next the water and formed bowers underwhich a boat could pass
the hills which form its shores are so steepand the woods on them were then so high that as you looked down fromthe west end it had the appearance of an amphitheatre for some kind ofsylvan spectacle
i have spent many an hour when i was youngerfloating over its surface as the zephyr willed having paddled my boatto the middle and lying on my back across the seats in a summerforenoon dreaming awake until i was aroused by the boat touching thesand and i arose to see what shore my fates had impelled me to dayswhen idleness was the most attractive and productive industry
many aforenoon have i stolen away preferring to spend thus the most valuedpart of the day for i was rich if not in money in sunny hours andsummer days and spent them lavishly nor do i regret that i did notwaste more of them in the workshop or the teacher’s desk
but since ileft those shores the woodchoppers have still further laid them wasteand now for many a year there will be no more rambling through theaisles of the wood with occasional vistas through which you see thewater
my muse may be excused if she is silent henceforth
how can youexpect the birds to sing when their groves are cut down
now the trunks of trees on the bottom and the old log canoe and thedark surrounding woods are gone and the villagers who scarcely knowwhere it lies instead of going to the pond to bathe or drink arethinking to bring its water which should be as sacred as the ganges atleast to the village in a pipe to wash their dishes with
—to earntheir walden by the turning of a cock or drawing of a plug
thatdevilish iron horse whose ear-rending neigh is heard throughout thetown has muddied the boiling spring with his foot and he it is thathas browsed off all the woods on walden shore that trojan horse witha thousand men in his belly introduced by mercenary greeks
where isthe country’s champion the moore of moore hill to meet him at thedeep cut and thrust an avenging lance between the ribs of the bloatedpest
nevertheless of all the characters i have known perhaps walden wearsbest and best preserves its purity
many men have been likened to itbut few deserve that honor
though the woodchoppers have laid barefirst this shore and then that and the irish have built their sties byit and the railroad has infringed on its border and the ice-men haveskimmed it once it is itself unchanged the same water which myyouthful eyes fell on all the change is in me
it has not acquired onepermanent wrinkle after all its ripples
it is perennially young and imay stand and see a swallow dip apparently to pick an insect from itssurface as of yore
it struck me again tonight as if i had not seen italmost daily for more than twenty years—why here is walden the samewoodland lake that i discovered so many years ago where a forest wascut down last winter another is springing up by its shore as lustily asever the same thought is welling up to its surface that was then itis the same liquid joy and happiness to itself and its maker ay andit _may_ be to me
it is the work of a brave man surely in whom therewas no guile
he rounded this water with his hand deepened andclarified it in his thought and in his will bequeathed it to concord
i see by its face that it is visited by the same reflection and i canalmost say walden is it you
it is no dream of mine     to ornament a line     i cannot come nearer to god and heaven     than i live to walden even
i am its stony shore     and the breeze that passes o’er     in the hollow of my hand     are its water and its sand     and its deepest resort     lies high in my thought
the cars never pause to look at it yet i fancy that the engineers andfiremen and brakemen and those passengers who have a season ticket andsee it often are better men for the sight
the engineer does notforget at night or his nature does not that he has beheld this visionof serenity and purity once at least during the day
though seen butonce it helps to wash out state-street and the engine’s soot
oneproposes that it be called “god’s drop
”i have said that walden has no visible inlet nor outlet but it is onthe one hand distantly and indirectly related to flint’s pond which ismore elevated by a chain of small ponds coming from that quarter andon the other directly and manifestly to concord river which is lowerby a similar chain of ponds through which in some other geologicalperiod it may have flowed and by a little digging which god forbidit can be made to flow thither again
if by living thus reserved andaustere like a hermit in the woods so long it has acquired suchwonderful purity who would not regret that the comparatively impurewaters of flint’s pond should be mingled with it or itself should evergo to waste its sweetness in the ocean wave
flint’s or sandy pond in lincoln our greatest lake and inland sealies about a mile east of walden
it is much larger being said tocontain one hundred and ninety-seven acres and is more fertile infish but it is comparatively shallow and not remarkably pure
a walkthrough the woods thither was often my recreation
it was worth thewhile if only to feel the wind blow on your cheek freely and see thewaves run and remember the life of mariners
i went a-chestnuttingthere in the fall on windy days when the nuts were dropping into thewater and were washed to my feet and one day as i crept along itssedgy shore the fresh spray blowing in my face i came upon themouldering wreck of a boat the sides gone and hardly more than theimpression of its flat bottom left amid the rushes yet its model wassharply defined as if it were a large decayed pad with its veins
itwas as impressive a wreck as one could imagine on the sea-shore andhad as good a moral
it is by this time mere vegetable mould andundistinguishable pond shore through which rushes and flags havepushed up
i used to admire the ripple marks on the sandy bottom atthe north end of this pond made firm and hard to the feet of the waderby the pressure of the water and the rushes which grew in indian filein waving lines corresponding to these marks rank behind rank as ifthe waves had planted them
there also i have found in considerablequantities curious balls composed apparently of fine grass or rootsof pipewort perhaps from half an inch to four inches in diameter andperfectly spherical
these wash back and forth in shallow water on asandy bottom and are sometimes cast on the shore
they are eithersolid grass or have a little sand in the middle
at first you wouldsay that they were formed by the action of the waves like a pebbleyet the smallest are made of equally coarse materials half an inchlong and they are produced only at one season of the year
moreoverthe waves i suspect do not so much construct as wear down a materialwhich has already acquired consistency
they preserve their form whendry for an indefinite period
_flint’s pond
_ such is the poverty of our nomenclature
what right hadthe unclean and stupid farmer whose farm abutted on this sky waterwhose shores he has ruthlessly laid bare to give his name to it
someskin-flint who loved better the reflecting surface of a dollar or abright cent in which he could see his own brazen face who regardedeven the wild ducks which settled in it as trespassers his fingersgrown into crooked and horny talons from the long habit of graspingharpy-like—so it is not named for me
i go not there to see him nor tohear of him who never _saw_ it who never bathed in it who neverloved it who never protected it who never spoke a good word for itnor thanked god that he had made it
rather let it be named from thefishes that swim in it the wild fowl or quadrupeds which frequent itthe wild flowers which grow by its shores or some wild man or childthe thread of whose history is interwoven with its own not from himwho could show no title to it but the deed which a like-minded neighboror legislature gave him—him who thought only of its money value whosepresence perchance cursed all the shore who exhausted the land aroundit and would fain have exhausted the waters within it who regrettedonly that it was not english hay or cranberry meadow—there was nothingto redeem it forsooth in his eyes—and would have drained and sold itfor the mud at its bottom
it did not turn his mill and it was no_privilege_ to him to behold it
i respect not his labors his farmwhere every thing has its price who would carry the landscape whowould carry his god to market if he could get any thing for him whogoes to market _for_ his god as it is on whose farm nothing growsfree whose fields bear no crops whose meadows no flowers whose treesno fruits but dollars who loves not the beauty of his fruits whosefruits are not ripe for him till they are turned to dollars
give methe poverty that enjoys true wealth
farmers are respectable andinteresting to me in proportion as they are poor—poor farmers
a modelfarm
where the house stands like a fungus in a muck-heap chambers formen horses oxen and swine cleansed and uncleansed all contiguousto one another
stocked with men
a great grease-spot redolent ofmanures and buttermilk
under a high state of cultivation beingmanured with the hearts and brains of men
as if you were to raise yourpotatoes in the church-yard
such is a model farm
no no if the fairest features of the landscape are to be named aftermen let them be the noblest and worthiest men alone
let our lakesreceive as true names at least as the icarian sea where “still theshore” a “brave attempt resounds
”goose pond of small extent is on my way to flint’s fair-haven anexpansion of concord river said to contain some seventy acres is amile south-west and white pond of about forty acres is a mile and ahalf beyond fair-haven
this is my lake country
these with concordriver are my water privileges and night and day year in year outthey grind such grist as i carry to them
since the woodcutters and the railroad and i myself have profanedwalden perhaps the most attractive if not the most beautiful of allour lakes the gem of the woods is white pond—a poor name from itscommonness whether derived from the remarkable purity of its waters orthe color of its sands
in these as in other respects however it is alesser twin of walden
they are so much alike that you would say theymust be connected under ground
it has the same stony shore and itswaters are of the same hue
as at walden in sultry dog-day weatherlooking down through the woods on some of its bays which are not sodeep but that the reflection from the bottom tinges them its watersare of a misty bluish-green or glaucous color
many years since i usedto go there to collect the sand by cart-loads to make sand-paper withand i have continued to visit it ever since
one who frequents itproposes to call it virid lake
perhaps it might be called yellow-pinelake from the following circumstance
about fifteen years ago youcould see the top of a pitch-pine of the kind called yellow-pinehereabouts though it is not a distinct species projecting above thesurface in deep water many rods from the shore
it was even supposedby some that the pond had sunk and this was one of the primitiveforest that formerly stood there
i find that even so long ago as 1792in a “topographical description of the town of concord” by one of itscitizens in the collections of the massachusetts historical societythe author after speaking of walden and white ponds adds “in themiddle of the latter may be seen when the water is very low a treewhich appears as if it grew in the place where it now stands althoughthe roots are fifty feet below the surface of the water the top ofthis tree is broken off and at that place measures fourteen inches indiameter
” in the spring of ’49 i talked with the man who lives nearestthe pond in sudbury who told me that it was he who got out this treeten or fifteen years before
as near as he could remember it stoodtwelve or fifteen rods from the shore where the water was thirty orforty feet deep
it was in the winter and he had been getting out icein the forenoon and had resolved that in the afternoon with the aidof his neighbors he would take out the old yellow-pine
he sawed achannel in the ice toward the shore and hauled it over and along andout on to the ice with oxen but before he had gone far in his workhe was surprised to find that it was wrong end upward with the stumpsof the branches pointing down and the small end firmly fastened in thesandy bottom
it was about a foot in diameter at the big end and hehad expected to get a good saw-log but it was so rotten as to be fitonly for fuel if for that
he had some of it in his shed then
therewere marks of an axe and of woodpeckers on the butt
he thought that itmight have been a dead tree on the shore but was finally blown overinto the pond and after the top had become waterlogged while thebutt-end was still dry and light had drifted out and sunk wrong endup
his father eighty years old could not remember when it was notthere
several pretty large logs may still be seen lying on the bottomwhere owing to the undulation of the surface they look like hugewater snakes in motion
this pond has rarely been profaned by a boat for there is little in itto tempt a fisherman
instead of the white lily which requires mud orthe common sweet flag the blue flag (_iris versicolor_) grows thinlyin the pure water rising from the stony bottom all around the shorewhere it is visited by humming birds in june and the color both of itsbluish blades and its flowers and especially their reflections are insingular harmony with the glaucous water
white pond and walden are great crystals on the surface of the earthlakes of light
if they were permanently congealed and small enough tobe clutched they would perchance be carried off by slaves likeprecious stones to adorn the heads of emperors but being liquid andample and secured to us and our successors forever we disregard themand run after the diamond of kohinoor
they are too pure to have amarket value they contain no muck
how much more beautiful than ourlives how much more transparent than our characters are they
wenever learned meanness of them
how much fairer than the pool beforethe farmer’s door in which his ducks swim
hither the clean wild duckscome
nature has no human inhabitant who appreciates her
the birdswith their plumage and their notes are in harmony with the flowers butwhat youth or maiden conspires with the wild luxuriant beauty ofnature
she flourishes most alone far from the towns where theyreside
talk of heaven
ye disgrace earth
baker farmsometimes i rambled to pine groves standing like temples or likefleets at sea full-rigged with wavy boughs and rippling with lightso soft and green and shady that the druids would have forsaken theiroaks to worship in them or to the cedar wood beyond flint’s pondwhere the trees covered with hoary blue berries spiring higher andhigher are fit to stand before valhalla and the creeping junipercovers the ground with wreaths full of fruit or to swamps where theusnea lichen hangs in festoons from the white-spruce trees andtoad-stools round tables of the swamp gods cover the ground and morebeautiful fungi adorn the stumps like butterflies or shells vegetablewinkles where the swamp-pink and dogwood grow the red alder-berryglows like eyes of imps the waxwork grooves and crushes the hardestwoods in its folds and the wild-holly berries make the beholder forgethis home with their beauty and he is dazzled and tempted by namelessother wild forbidden fruits too fair for mortal taste
instead ofcalling on some scholar i paid many a visit to particular trees ofkinds which are rare in this neighborhood standing far away in themiddle of some pasture or in the depths of a wood or swamp or on ahill-top such as the black-birch of which we have some handsomespecimens two feet in diameter its cousin the yellow birch with itsloose golden vest perfumed like the first the beech which has soneat a bole and beautifully lichen-painted perfect in all its detailsof which excepting scattered specimens i know but one small grove ofsizable trees left in the township supposed by some to have beenplanted by the pigeons that were once baited with beech nuts near byit is worth the while to see the silver grain sparkle when you splitthis wood the bass the hornbeam the _celtis occidentalis_ or falseelm of which we have but one well-grown some taller mast of a pine ashingle tree or a more perfect hemlock than usual standing like apagoda in the midst of the woods and many others i could mention
these were the shrines i visited both summer and winter
once it chanced that i stood in the very abutment of a rainbow’s archwhich filled the lower stratum of the atmosphere tinging the grass andleaves around and dazzling me as if i looked through colored crystal
it was a lake of rainbow light in which for a short while i livedlike a dolphin
if it had lasted longer it might have tinged myemployments and life
as i walked on the railroad causeway i used towonder at the halo of light around my shadow and would fain fancymyself one of the elect
one who visited me declared that the shadowsof some irishmen before him had no halo about them that it was onlynatives that were so distinguished
benvenuto cellini tells us in hismemoirs that after a certain terrible dream or vision which he hadduring his confinement in the castle of st
angelo a resplendent lightappeared over the shadow of his head at morning and evening whether hewas in italy or france and it was particularly conspicuous when thegrass was moist with dew
this was probably the same phenomenon towhich i have referred which is especially observed in the morning butalso at other times and even by moonlight
though a constant one itis not commonly noticed and in the case of an excitable imaginationlike cellini’s it would be basis enough for superstition
beside hetells us that he showed it to very few
but are they not indeeddistinguished who are conscious that they are regarded at all
i set out one afternoon to go a-fishing to fair-haven through thewoods to eke out my scanty fare of vegetables
my way led throughpleasant meadow an adjunct of the baker farm that retreat of which apoet has since sung beginning—     “thy entry is a pleasant field     which some mossy fruit trees yield     partly to a ruddy brook     by gliding musquash undertook     and mercurial trout     darting about
”i thought of living there before i went to walden
i “hooked” theapples leaped the brook and scared the musquash and the trout
it wasone of those afternoons which seem indefinitely long before one inwhich many events may happen a large portion of our natural lifethough it was already half spent when i started
by the way there cameup a shower which compelled me to stand half an hour under a pinepiling boughs over my head and wearing my handkerchief for a shed andwhen at length i had made one cast over the pickerel-weed standing upto my middle in water i found myself suddenly in the shadow of acloud and the thunder began to rumble with such emphasis that i coulddo no more than listen to it
the gods must be proud thought i withsuch forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman
so i made hastefor shelter to the nearest hut which stood half a mile from any roadbut so much the nearer to the pond and had long been uninhabited—     “and here a poet builded         in the completed years     for behold a trivial cabin         that to destruction steers
”so the muse fables
but therein as i found dwelt now john field anirishman and his wife and several children from the broad-faced boywho assisted his father at his work and now came running by his sidefrom the bog to escape the rain to the wrinkled sibyl-likecone-headed infant that sat upon its father’s knee as in the palaces ofnobles and looked out from its home in the midst of wet and hungerinquisitively upon the stranger with the privilege of infancy notknowing but it was the last of a noble line and the hope and cynosureof the world instead of john field’s poor starveling brat
there wesat together under that part of the roof which leaked the least whileit showered and thundered without
i had sat there many times of oldbefore the ship was built that floated his family to america
anhonest hard-working but shiftless man plainly was john field and hiswife she too was brave to cook so many successive dinners in therecesses of that lofty stove with round greasy face and bare breaststill thinking to improve her condition one day with the never absentmop in one hand and yet no effects of it visible anywhere
thechickens which had also taken shelter here from the rain stalkedabout the room like members of the family too humanized methought toroast well
they stood and looked in my eye or pecked at my shoesignificantly
meanwhile my host told me his story how hard he worked“bogging” for a neighboring farmer turning up a meadow with a spade orbog hoe at the rate of ten dollars an acre and the use of the land withmanure for one year and his little broad-faced son worked cheerfullyat his father’s side the while not knowing how poor a bargain thelatter had made
i tried to help him with my experience telling himthat he was one of my nearest neighbors and that i too who camea-fishing here and looked like a loafer was getting my living likehimself that i lived in a tight light and clean house which hardlycost more than the annual rent of such a ruin as his commonly amountsto and how if he chose he might in a month or two build himself apalace of his own that i did not use tea nor coffee nor butter normilk nor fresh meat and so did not have to work to get them againas i did not work hard i did not have to eat hard and it cost me buta trifle for my food but as he began with tea and coffee and butterand milk and beef he had to work hard to pay for them and when hehad worked hard he had to eat hard again to repair the waste of hissystem—and so it was as broad as it was long indeed it was broaderthan it was long for he was discontented and wasted his life into thebargain and yet he had rated it as a gain in coming to america thathere you could get tea and coffee and meat every day
but the onlytrue america is that country where you are at liberty to pursue such amode of life as may enable you to do without these and where the statedoes not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war andother superfluous expenses which directly or indirectly result from theuse of such things
for i purposely talked to him as if he were aphilosopher or desired to be one
i should be glad if all the meadowson the earth were left in a wild state if that were the consequence ofmen’s beginning to redeem themselves
a man will not need to studyhistory to find out what is best for his own culture
but alas
theculture of an irishman is an enterprise to be undertaken with a sort ofmoral bog hoe
i told him that as he worked so hard at bogging herequired thick boots and stout clothing which yet were soon soiled andworn out but i wore light shoes and thin clothing which cost not halfso much though he might think that i was dressed like a gentleman(which however was not the case) and in an hour or two withoutlabor but as a recreation i could if i wished catch as many fish asi should want for two days or earn enough money to support me a week
if he and his family would live simply they might all goa-huckleberrying in the summer for their amusement
john heaved a sighat this and his wife stared with arms a-kimbo and both appeared to bewondering if they had capital enough to begin such a course with orarithmetic enough to carry it through
it was sailing by dead reckoningto them and they saw not clearly how to make their port so thereforei suppose they still take life bravely after their fashion face toface giving it tooth and nail not having skill to split its massivecolumns with any fine entering wedge and rout it in detail—thinkingto deal with it roughly as one should handle a thistle
but they fightat an overwhelming disadvantage—living john field alas
withoutarithmetic and failing so
“do you ever fish
” i asked
“oh yes i catch a mess now and then wheni am lying by good perch i catch
” “what’s your bait
” “i catchshiners with fish-worms and bait the perch with them
” “you’d bettergo now john” said his wife with glistening and hopeful face butjohn demurred
the shower was now over and a rainbow above the eastern woods promiseda fair evening so i took my departure
when i had got without i askedfor a drink hoping to get a sight of the well bottom to complete mysurvey of the premises but there alas
are shallows and quicksandsand rope broken withal and bucket irrecoverable
meanwhile the rightculinary vessel was selected water was seemingly distilled and afterconsultation and long delay passed out to the thirsty one—not yetsuffered to cool not yet to settle
such gruel sustains life here ithought so shutting my eyes and excluding the motes by a skilfullydirected under-current i drank to genuine hospitality the heartiestdraught i could
i am not squeamish in such cases when manners areconcerned
as i was leaving the irishman’s roof after the rain bending my stepsagain to the pond my haste to catch pickerel wading in retiredmeadows in sloughs and bog-holes in forlorn and savage placesappeared for an instant trivial to me who had been sent to school andcollege but as i ran down the hill toward the reddening west with therainbow over my shoulder and some faint tinkling sounds borne to myear through the cleansed air from i know not what quarter my goodgenius seemed to say—go fish and hunt far and wide day by day—fartherand wider—and rest thee by many brooks and hearth-sides withoutmisgiving
remember thy creator in the days of thy youth
rise freefrom care before the dawn and seek adventures
let the noon find theeby other lakes and the night overtake thee everywhere at home
thereare no larger fields than these no worthier games than may here beplayed
grow wild according to thy nature like these sedges andbrakes which will never become english hay
let the thunder rumblewhat if it threaten ruin to farmers’ crops
that is not its errand tothee
take shelter under the cloud while they flee to carts and sheds
let not to get a living be thy trade but thy sport
enjoy the landbut own it not
through want of enterprise and faith men are where theyare buying and selling and spending their lives like serfs

before i had reached the pond some fresh impulse had brought out johnfield with altered mind letting go “bogging” ere this sunset
but hepoor man disturbed only a couple of fins while i was catching a fairstring and he said it was his luck but when we changed seats in theboat luck changed seats too
poor john field
—i trust he does not readthis unless he will improve by it—thinking to live by some derivativeold country mode in this primitive new country—to catch perch withshiners
it is good bait sometimes i allow
with his horizon all hisown yet he a poor man born to be poor with his inherited irishpoverty or poor life his adam’s grandmother and boggy ways not torise in this world he nor his posterity till their wading webbedbog-trotting feet get _talaria_ to their heels
higher lawsas i came home through the woods with my string of fish trailing mypole it being now quite dark i caught a glimpse of a woodchuckstealing across my path and felt a strange thrill of savage delightand was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw not that i washungry then except for that wildness which he represented
once ortwice however while i lived at the pond i found myself ranging thewoods like a half-starved hound with a strange abandonment seekingsome kind of venison which i might devour and no morsel could havebeen too savage for me
the wildest scenes had become unaccountablyfamiliar
i found in myself and still find an instinct toward ahigher or as it is named spiritual life as do most men and anothertoward a primitive rank and savage one and i reverence them both
ilove the wild not less than the good
the wildness and adventure thatare in fishing still recommended it to me
i like sometimes to takerank hold on life and spend my day more as the animals do
perhaps ihave owed to this employment and to hunting when quite young myclosest acquaintance with nature
they early introduce us to and detainus in scenery with which otherwise at that age we should have littleacquaintance
fishermen hunters woodchoppers and others spendingtheir lives in the fields and woods in a peculiar sense a part ofnature themselves are often in a more favorable mood for observingher in the intervals of their pursuits than philosophers or poetseven who approach her with expectation
she is not afraid to exhibitherself to them
the traveller on the prairie is naturally a hunter onthe head waters of the missouri and columbia a trapper and at thefalls of st
mary a fisherman
he who is only a traveller learns thingsat second-hand and by the halves and is poor authority
we are mostinterested when science reports what those men already know practicallyor instinctively for that alone is a true _humanity_ or account ofhuman experience
they mistake who assert that the yankee has few amusements because hehas not so many public holidays and men and boys do not play so manygames as they do in england for here the more primitive but solitaryamusements of hunting fishing and the like have not yet given place tothe former
almost every new england boy among my contemporariesshouldered a fowling piece between the ages of ten and fourteen andhis hunting and fishing grounds were not limited like the preserves ofan english nobleman but were more boundless even than those of asavage
no wonder then that he did not oftener stay to play on thecommon
but already a change is taking place owing not to anincreased humanity but to an increased scarcity of game for perhapsthe hunter is the greatest friend of the animals hunted not exceptingthe humane society
moreover when at the pond i wished sometimes to add fish to my farefor variety
i have actually fished from the same kind of necessitythat the first fishers did
whatever humanity i might conjure upagainst it was all factitious and concerned my philosophy more than myfeelings
i speak of fishing only now for i had long felt differentlyabout fowling and sold my gun before i went to the woods
not that iam less humane than others but i did not perceive that my feelingswere much affected
i did not pity the fishes nor the worms
this washabit
as for fowling during the last years that i carried a gun myexcuse was that i was studying ornithology and sought only new or rarebirds
but i confess that i am now inclined to think that there is afiner way of studying ornithology than this
it requires so much closerattention to the habits of the birds that if for that reason only ihave been willing to omit the gun
yet notwithstanding the objection onthe score of humanity i am compelled to doubt if equally valuablesports are ever substituted for these and when some of my friends haveasked me anxiously about their boys whether they should let them hunti have answered yes—remembering that it was one of the best parts ofmy education—_make_ them hunters though sportsmen only at first ifpossible mighty hunters at last so that they shall not find gamelarge enough for them in this or any vegetable wilderness—hunters aswell as fishers of men
thus far i am of the opinion of chaucer’s nunwho     “yave not of the text a pulled hen     that saith that hunters ben not holy men
”there is a period in the history of the individual as of the racewhen the hunters are the “best men” as the algonquins called them
wecannot but pity the boy who has never fired a gun he is no morehumane while his education has been sadly neglected
this was myanswer with respect to those youths who were bent on this pursuittrusting that they would soon outgrow it
no humane being past thethoughtless age of boyhood will wantonly murder any creature whichholds its life by the same tenure that he does
the hare in itsextremity cries like a child
i warn you mothers that my sympathiesdo not always make the usual phil-_anthropic_ distinctions
such is oftenest the young man’s introduction to the forest and themost original part of himself
he goes thither at first as a hunter andfisher until at last if he has the seeds of a better life in him hedistinguishes his proper objects as a poet or naturalist it may beand leaves the gun and fish-pole behind
the mass of men are still andalways young in this respect
in some countries a hunting parson is nouncommon sight
such a one might make a good shepherd’s dog but is farfrom being the good shepherd
i have been surprised to consider thatthe only obvious employment except wood-chopping ice-cutting or thelike business which ever to my knowledge detained at walden pond for awhole half day any of my fellow-citizens whether fathers or childrenof the town with just one exception was fishing
commonly they didnot think that they were lucky or well paid for their time unlessthey got a long string of fish though they had the opportunity ofseeing the pond all the while
they might go there a thousand timesbefore the sediment of fishing would sink to the bottom and leave theirpurpose pure but no doubt such a clarifying process would be going onall the while
the governor and his council faintly remember the pondfor they went a-fishing there when they were boys but now they are tooold and dignified to go a-fishing and so they know it no more forever
yet even they expect to go to heaven at last
if the legislatureregards it it is chiefly to regulate the number of hooks to be usedthere but they know nothing about the hook of hooks with which toangle for the pond itself impaling the legislature for a bait
thuseven in civilized communities the embryo man passes through the hunterstage of development
i have found repeatedly of late years that i cannot fish withoutfalling a little in self-respect
i have tried it again and again
ihave skill at it and like many of my fellows a certain instinct forit which revives from time to time but always when i have done i feelthat it would have been better if i had not fished
i think that i donot mistake
it is a faint intimation yet so are the first streaks ofmorning
there is unquestionably this instinct in me which belongs tothe lower orders of creation yet with every year i am less afisherman though without more humanity or even wisdom at present i amno fisherman at all
but i see that if i were to live in a wilderness ishould again be tempted to become a fisher and hunter in earnest
beside there is something essentially unclean about this diet and allflesh and i began to see where housework commences and whence theendeavor which costs so much to wear a tidy and respectableappearance each day to keep the house sweet and free from all illodors and sights
having been my own butcher and scullion and cook aswell as the gentleman for whom the dishes were served up i can speakfrom an unusually complete experience
the practical objection toanimal food in my case was its uncleanness and besides when i hadcaught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish they seemed not tohave fed me essentially
it was insignificant and unnecessary and costmore than it came to
a little bread or a few potatoes would have doneas well with less trouble and filth
like many of my contemporaries ihad rarely for many years used animal food or tea or coffee &c
notso much because of any ill effects which i had traced to them asbecause they were not agreeable to my imagination
the repugnance toanimal food is not the effect of experience but is an instinct
itappeared more beautiful to live low and fare hard in many respects andthough i never did so i went far enough to please my imagination
ibelieve that every man who has ever been earnest to preserve his higheror poetic faculties in the best condition has been particularlyinclined to abstain from animal food and from much food of any kind
it is a significant fact stated by entomologists i find it in kirbyand spence that “some insects in their perfect state though furnishedwith organs of feeding make no use of them” and they lay it down as“a general rule that almost all insects in this state eat much lessthan in that of larvæ
the voracious caterpillar when transformed intoa butterfly”

“and the gluttonous maggot when become a fly”content themselves with a drop or two of honey or some other sweetliquid
the abdomen under the wings of the butterfly still representsthe larva
this is the tid-bit which tempts his insectivorous fate
thegross feeder is a man in the larva state and there are whole nationsin that condition nations without fancy or imagination whose vastabdomens betray them
it is hard to provide and cook so simple and clean a diet as will notoffend the imagination but this i think is to be fed when we feedthe body they should both sit down at the same table
yet perhaps thismay be done
the fruits eaten temperately need not make us ashamed ofour appetites nor interrupt the worthiest pursuits
but put an extracondiment into your dish and it will poison you
it is not worth thewhile to live by rich cookery
most men would feel shame if caughtpreparing with their own hands precisely such a dinner whether ofanimal or vegetable food as is every day prepared for them by others
yet till this is otherwise we are not civilized and if gentlemen andladies are not true men and women
this certainly suggests what changeis to be made
it may be vain to ask why the imagination will not bereconciled to flesh and fat
i am satisfied that it is not
is it not areproach that man is a carnivorous animal
true he can and does livein a great measure by preying on other animals but this is amiserable way—as any one who will go to snaring rabbits orslaughtering lambs may learn—and he will be regarded as a benefactorof his race who shall teach man to confine himself to a more innocentand wholesome diet
whatever my own practice may be i have no doubtthat it is a part of the destiny of the human race in its gradualimprovement to leave off eating animals as surely as the savagetribes have left off eating each other when they came in contact withthe more civilized
if one listens to the faintest but constant suggestions of his geniuswhich are certainly true he sees not to what extremes or eveninsanity it may lead him and yet that way as he grows more resoluteand faithful his road lies
the faintest assured objection which onehealthy man feels will at length prevail over the arguments and customsof mankind
no man ever followed his genius till it misled him
thoughthe result were bodily weakness yet perhaps no one can say that theconsequences were to be regretted for these were a life in conformityto higher principles
if the day and the night are such that you greetthem with joy and life emits a fragrance like flowers andsweet-scented herbs is more elastic more starry more immortal—thatis your success
all nature is your congratulation and you have causemomentarily to bless yourself
the greatest gains and values arefarthest from being appreciated
we easily come to doubt if they exist
we soon forget them
they are the highest reality
perhaps the factsmost astounding and most real are never communicated by man to man
thetrue harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible andindescribable as the tints of morning or evening
it is a littlestar-dust caught a segment of the rainbow which i have clutched
yet for my part i was never unusually squeamish i could sometimeseat a fried rat with a good relish if it were necessary
i am glad tohave drunk water so long for the same reason that i prefer the naturalsky to an opium-eater’s heaven
i would fain keep sober always andthere are infinite degrees of drunkenness
i believe that water is theonly drink for a wise man wine is not so noble a liquor and think ofdashing the hopes of a morning with a cup of warm coffee or of anevening with a dish of tea
ah how low i fall when i am tempted bythem
even music may be intoxicating
such apparently slight causesdestroyed greece and rome and will destroy england and america
of allebriosity who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air hebreathes
i have found it to be the most serious objection to coarselabors long continued that they compelled me to eat and drink coarselyalso
but to tell the truth i find myself at present somewhat lessparticular in these respects
i carry less religion to the table askno blessing not because i am wiser than i was but i am obliged toconfess because however much it is to be regretted with years i havegrown more coarse and indifferent
perhaps these questions areentertained only in youth as most believe of poetry
my practice is“nowhere” my opinion is here
nevertheless i am far from regardingmyself as one of those privileged ones to whom the ved refers when itsays that “he who has true faith in the omnipresent supreme being mayeat all that exists” that is is not bound to inquire what is hisfood or who prepares it and even in their case it is to be observedas a hindoo commentator has remarked that the vedant limits thisprivilege to “the time of distress
”who has not sometimes derived an inexpressible satisfaction from hisfood in which appetite had no share
i have been thrilled to think thati owed a mental perception to the commonly gross sense of taste that ihave been inspired through the palate that some berries which i hadeaten on a hill-side had fed my genius
“the soul not being mistress ofherself” says thseng-tseu “one looks and one does not see onelistens and one does not hear one eats and one does not know thesavor of food
” he who distinguishes the true savor of his food cannever be a glutton he who does not cannot be otherwise
a puritan maygo to his brown-bread crust with as gross an appetite as ever analderman to his turtle
not that food which entereth into the mouthdefileth a man but the appetite with which it is eaten
it is neitherthe quality nor the quantity but the devotion to sensual savors whenthat which is eaten is not a viand to sustain our animal or inspireour spiritual life but food for the worms that possess us
if thehunter has a taste for mud-turtles muskrats and other such savagetid-bits the fine lady indulges a taste for jelly made of a calf’sfoot or for sardines from over the sea and they are even
he goes tothe mill-pond she to her preserve-pot
the wonder is how they how youand i can live this slimy beastly life eating and drinking
our whole life is startlingly moral
there is never an instant’s trucebetween virtue and vice
goodness is the only investment that neverfails
in the music of the harp which trembles round the world it isthe insisting on this which thrills us
the harp is the travellingpatterer for the universe’s insurance company recommending its lawsand our little goodness is all the assessment that we pay
though theyouth at last grows indifferent the laws of the universe are notindifferent but are forever on the side of the most sensitive
listento every zephyr for some reproof for it is surely there and he isunfortunate who does not hear it
we cannot touch a string or move astop but the charming moral transfixes us
many an irksome noise go along way off is heard as music a proud sweet satire on the meannessof our lives
we are conscious of an animal in us which awakens in proportion as ourhigher nature slumbers
it is reptile and sensual and perhaps cannotbe wholly expelled like the worms which even in life and healthoccupy our bodies
possibly we may withdraw from it but never changeits nature
i fear that it may enjoy a certain health of its own thatwe may be well yet not pure
the other day i picked up the lower jawof a hog with white and sound teeth and tusks which suggested thatthere was an animal health and vigor distinct from the spiritual
thiscreature succeeded by other means than temperance and purity
“that inwhich men differ from brute beasts” says mencius “is a thing veryinconsiderable the common herd lose it very soon superior menpreserve it carefully
” who knows what sort of life would result if wehad attained to purity
if i knew so wise a man as could teach mepurity i would go to seek him forthwith
“a command over our passionsand over the external senses of the body and good acts are declaredby the ved to be indispensable in the mind’s approximation to god
” yetthe spirit can for the time pervade and control every member andfunction of the body and transmute what in form is the grossestsensuality into purity and devotion
the generative energy which whenwe are loose dissipates and makes us unclean when we are continentinvigorates and inspires us
chastity is the flowering of man and whatare called genius heroism holiness and the like are but variousfruits which succeed it
man flows at once to god when the channel ofpurity is open
by turns our purity inspires and our impurity casts usdown
he is blessed who is assured that the animal is dying out in himday by day and the divine being established
perhaps there is none buthas cause for shame on account of the inferior and brutish nature towhich he is allied
i fear that we are such gods or demigods only asfauns and satyrs the divine allied to beasts the creatures ofappetite and that to some extent our very life is our disgrace
—     “how happy’s he who hath due place assigned     to his beasts and disafforested his mind
*    *    *    *    *     can use this horse goat wolf and ev’ry beast     and is not ass himself to all the rest
else man not only is the herd of swine     but he’s those devils too which did incline     them to a headlong rage and made them worse
”all sensuality is one though it takes many forms all purity is one
it is the same whether a man eat or drink or cohabit or sleepsensually
they are but one appetite and we only need to see a persondo any one of these things to know how great a sensualist he is
theimpure can neither stand nor sit with purity
when the reptile isattacked at one mouth of his burrow he shows himself at another
ifyou would be chaste you must be temperate
what is chastity
how shalla man know if he is chaste
he shall not know it
we have heard of thisvirtue but we know not what it is
we speak conformably to the rumorwhich we have heard
from exertion come wisdom and purity from slothignorance and sensuality
in the student sensuality is a sluggish habitof mind
an unclean person is universally a slothful one one who sitsby a stove whom the sun shines on prostrate who reposes without beingfatigued
if you would avoid uncleanness and all the sins workearnestly though it be at cleaning a stable
nature is hard to beovercome but she must be overcome
what avails it that you arechristian if you are not purer than the heathen if you deny yourselfno more if you are not more religious
i know of many systems ofreligion esteemed heathenish whose precepts fill the reader with shameand provoke him to new endeavors though it be to the performance ofrites merely
i hesitate to say these things but it is not because of the subject—icare not how obscene my _words_ are—but because i cannot speak of themwithout betraying my impurity
we discourse freely without shame of oneform of sensuality and are silent about another
we are so degradedthat we cannot speak simply of the necessary functions of human nature
in earlier ages in some countries every function was reverentlyspoken of and regulated by law
nothing was too trivial for the hindoolawgiver however offensive it may be to modern taste
he teaches howto eat drink cohabit void excrement and urine and the likeelevating what is mean and does not falsely excuse himself by callingthese things trifles
every man is the builder of a temple called his body to the god heworships after a style purely his own nor can he get off by hammeringmarble instead
we are all sculptors and painters and our material isour own flesh and blood and bones
any nobleness begins at once torefine a man’s features any meanness or sensuality to imbrute them
john farmer sat at his door one september evening after a hard day’swork his mind still running on his labor more or less
having bathedhe sat down to re-create his intellectual man
it was a rather coolevening and some of his neighbors were apprehending a frost
he hadnot attended to the train of his thoughts long when he heard some oneplaying on a flute and that sound harmonized with his mood
still hethought of his work but the burden of his thought was that thoughthis kept running in his head and he found himself planning andcontriving it against his will yet it concerned him very little
itwas no more than the scurf of his skin which was constantly shuffledoff
but the notes of the flute came home to his ears out of adifferent sphere from that he worked in and suggested work for certainfaculties which slumbered in him
they gently did away with the streetand the village and the state in which he lived
a voice said tohim—why do you stay here and live this mean moiling life when aglorious existence is possible for you
those same stars twinkle overother fields than these
—but how to come out of this condition andactually migrate thither
all that he could think of was to practisesome new austerity to let his mind descend into his body and redeemit and treat himself with ever increasing respect
brute neighborssometimes i had a companion in my fishing who came through the villageto my house from the other side of the town and the catching of thedinner was as much a social exercise as the eating of it
_hermit
_ i wonder what the world is doing now
i have not heard somuch as a locust over the sweet-fern these three hours
the pigeons areall asleep upon their roosts—no flutter from them
was that a farmer’snoon horn which sounded from beyond the woods just now
the hands arecoming in to boiled salt beef and cider and indian bread
why will menworry themselves so
he that does not eat need not work
i wonder howmuch they have reaped
who would live there where a body can neverthink for the barking of bose
and o the housekeeping
to keep brightthe devil’s door-knobs and scour his tubs this bright day
better notkeep a house
say some hollow tree and then for morning calls anddinner-parties
only a woodpecker tapping
o they swarm the sun istoo warm there they are born too far into life for me
i have waterfrom the spring and a loaf of brown bread on the shelf
—hark
i hear arustling of the leaves
is it some ill-fed village hound yielding tothe instinct of the chase
or the lost pig which is said to be in thesewoods whose tracks i saw after the rain
it comes on apace my sumachsand sweet-briers tremble
—eh mr
poet is it you
how do you like theworld to-day
_poet
_ see those clouds how they hang
that’s the greatest thing ihave seen to-day
there’s nothing like it in old paintings nothinglike it in foreign lands—unless when we were off the coast of spain
that’s a true mediterranean sky
i thought as i have my living to getand have not eaten to-day that i might go a-fishing
that’s the trueindustry for poets
it is the only trade i have learned
come let’salong
_hermit
_ i cannot resist
my brown bread will soon be gone
i will gowith you gladly soon but i am just concluding a serious meditation
ithink that i am near the end of it
leave me alone then for a while
but that we may not be delayed you shall be digging the baitmeanwhile
angle-worms are rarely to be met with in these parts wherethe soil was never fattened with manure the race is nearly extinct
the sport of digging the bait is nearly equal to that of catching thefish when one’s appetite is not too keen and this you may have all toyourself to-day
i would advise you to set in the spade down yonderamong the ground-nuts where you see the johnswort waving
i think thati may warrant you one worm to every three sods you turn up if you lookwell in among the roots of the grass as if you were weeding
or ifyou choose to go farther it will not be unwise for i have found theincrease of fair bait to be very nearly as the squares of thedistances
_hermit alone
_ let me see where was i
methinks i was nearly in thisframe of mind the world lay about at this angle
shall i go to heavenor a-fishing
if i should soon bring this meditation to an end wouldanother so sweet occasion be likely to offer
i was as near beingresolved into the essence of things as ever i was in my life
i fear mythoughts will not come back to me
if it would do any good i wouldwhistle for them
when they make us an offer is it wise to say wewill think of it
my thoughts have left no track and i cannot find thepath again
what was it that i was thinking of
it was a very hazy day
i will just try these three sentences of con-fut-see they may fetchthat state about again
i know not whether it was the dumps or abudding ecstasy
mem
there never is but one opportunity of a kind
_poet
_ how now hermit is it too soon
i have got just thirteen wholeones beside several which are imperfect or undersized but they willdo for the smaller fry they do not cover up the hook so much
thosevillage worms are quite too large a shiner may make a meal off onewithout finding the skewer
_hermit
_ well then let’s be off
shall we to the concord
there’sgood sport there if the water be not too high
why do precisely these objects which we behold make a world
why hasman just these species of animals for his neighbors as if nothing buta mouse could have filled this crevice
i suspect that pilpay & co
have put animals to their best use for they are all beasts of burdenin a sense made to carry some portion of our thoughts
the mice which haunted my house were not the common ones which aresaid to have been introduced into the country but a wild native kindnot found in the village
i sent one to a distinguished naturalist andit interested him much
when i was building one of these had its nestunderneath the house and before i had laid the second floor and sweptout the shavings would come out regularly at lunch time and pick upthe crumbs at my feet
it probably had never seen a man before and itsoon became quite familiar and would run over my shoes and up myclothes
it could readily ascend the sides of the room by shortimpulses like a squirrel which it resembled in its motions
atlength as i leaned with my elbow on the bench one day it ran up myclothes and along my sleeve and round and round the paper which heldmy dinner while i kept the latter close and dodged and played atbopeep with it and when at last i held still a piece of cheese betweenmy thumb and finger it came and nibbled it sitting in my hand andafterward cleaned its face and paws like a fly and walked away
a phœbe soon built in my shed and a robin for protection in a pinewhich grew against the house
in june the partridge (_tetraoumbellus_) which is so shy a bird led her brood past my windows fromthe woods in the rear to the front of my house clucking and calling tothem like a hen and in all her behavior proving herself the hen of thewoods
the young suddenly disperse on your approach at a signal fromthe mother as if a whirlwind had swept them away and they so exactlyresemble the dried leaves and twigs that many a traveler has placed hisfoot in the midst of a brood and heard the whir of the old bird as sheflew off and her anxious calls and mewing or seen her trail her wingsto attract his attention without suspecting their neighborhood
theparent will sometimes roll and spin round before you in such adishabille that you cannot for a few moments detect what kind ofcreature it is
the young squat still and flat often running theirheads under a leaf and mind only their mother’s directions given froma distance nor will your approach make them run again and betraythemselves
you may even tread on them or have your eyes on them for aminute without discovering them
i have held them in my open hand atsuch a time and still their only care obedient to their mother andtheir instinct was to squat there without fear or trembling
soperfect is this instinct that once when i had laid them on the leavesagain and one accidentally fell on its side it was found with therest in exactly the same position ten minutes afterward
they are notcallow like the young of most birds but more perfectly developed andprecocious even than chickens
the remarkably adult yet innocentexpression of their open and serene eyes is very memorable
allintelligence seems reflected in them
they suggest not merely thepurity of infancy but a wisdom clarified by experience
such an eyewas not born when the bird was but is coeval with the sky it reflects
the woods do not yield another such a gem
the traveller does not oftenlook into such a limpid well
the ignorant or reckless sportsman oftenshoots the parent at such a time and leaves these innocents to fall aprey to some prowling beast or bird or gradually mingle with thedecaying leaves which they so much resemble
it is said that whenhatched by a hen they will directly disperse on some alarm and so arelost for they never hear the mother’s call which gathers them again
these were my hens and chickens
it is remarkable how many creatures live wild and free though secret inthe woods and still sustain themselves in the neighborhood of townssuspected by hunters only
how retired the otter manages to live here
he grows to be four feet long as big as a small boy perhaps withoutany human being getting a glimpse of him
i formerly saw the raccoon inthe woods behind where my house is built and probably still heardtheir whinnering at night
commonly i rested an hour or two in theshade at noon after planting and ate my lunch and read a little by aspring which was the source of a swamp and of a brook oozing fromunder brister’s hill half a mile from my field
the approach to thiswas through a succession of descending grassy hollows full of youngpitch-pines into a larger wood about the swamp
there in a verysecluded and shaded spot under a spreading white-pine there was yet aclean firm sward to sit on
i had dug out the spring and made a wellof clear gray water where i could dip up a pailful without roiling itand thither i went for this purpose almost every day in midsummer whenthe pond was warmest
thither too the wood-cock led her brood toprobe the mud for worms flying but a foot above them down the bankwhile they ran in a troop beneath but at last spying me she wouldleave her young and circle round and round me nearer and nearer tillwithin four or five feet pretending broken wings and legs to attractmy attention and get off her young who would already have taken uptheir march with faint wiry peep single file through the swamp asshe directed
or i heard the peep of the young when i could not see theparent bird
there too the turtle-doves sat over the spring orfluttered from bough to bough of the soft white-pines over my head orthe red squirrel coursing down the nearest bough was particularlyfamiliar and inquisitive
you only need sit still long enough in someattractive spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibitthemselves to you by turns
i was witness to events of a less peaceful character
one day when iwent out to my wood-pile or rather my pile of stumps i observed twolarge ants the one red the other much larger nearly half an inchlong and black fiercely contending with one another
having once gothold they never let go but struggled and wrestled and rolled on thechips incessantly
looking farther i was surprised to find that thechips were covered with such combatants that it was not a _duellum_but a _bellum_ a war between two races of ants the red always pittedagainst the black and frequently two red ones to one black
thelegions of these myrmidons covered all the hills and vales in mywood-yard and the ground was already strewn with the dead and dyingboth red and black
it was the only battle which i have ever witnessedthe only battle-field i ever trod while the battle was raginginternecine war the red republicans on the one hand and the blackimperialists on the other
on every side they were engaged in deadlycombat yet without any noise that i could hear and human soldiersnever fought so resolutely
i watched a couple that were fast locked ineach other’s embraces in a little sunny valley amid the chips now atnoon-day prepared to fight till the sun went down or life went out
the smaller red champion had fastened himself like a vice to hisadversary’s front and through all the tumblings on that field neverfor an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the roothaving already caused the other to go by the board while the strongerblack one dashed him from side to side and as i saw on lookingnearer had already divested him of several of his members
they foughtwith more pertinacity than bull-dogs
neither manifested the leastdisposition to retreat
it was evident that their battle-cry wasconquer or die
in the mean while there came along a single red ant onthe hill-side of this valley evidently full of excitement who eitherhad despatched his foe or had not yet taken part in the battleprobably the latter for he had lost none of his limbs whose motherhad charged him to return with his shield or upon it
or perchance hewas some achilles who had nourished his wrath apart and had now cometo avenge or rescue his patroclus
he saw this unequal combat fromafar—for the blacks were nearly twice the size of the red—he drewnear with rapid pace till he stood on his guard within half an inch ofthe combatants then watching his opportunity he sprang upon theblack warrior and commenced his operations near the root of his rightfore-leg leaving the foe to select among his own members and so therewere three united for life as if a new kind of attraction had beeninvented which put all other locks and cements to shame
i should nothave wondered by this time to find that they had their respectivemusical bands stationed on some eminent chip and playing theirnational airs the while to excite the slow and cheer the dyingcombatants
i was myself excited somewhat even as if they had been men
the more you think of it the less the difference
and certainly thereis not the fight recorded in concord history at least if in thehistory of america that will bear a moment’s comparison with thiswhether for the numbers engaged in it or for the patriotism andheroism displayed
for numbers and for carnage it was an austerlitz ordresden
concord fight
two killed on the patriots’ side and lutherblanchard wounded
why here every ant was a buttrick—“fire
for god’ssake fire
”—and thousands shared the fate of davis and hosmer
therewas not one hireling there
i have no doubt that it was a principlethey fought for as much as our ancestors and not to avoid athree-penny tax on their tea and the results of this battle will be asimportant and memorable to those whom it concerns as those of thebattle of bunker hill at least
i took up the chip on which the three i have particularly describedwere struggling carried it into my house and placed it under atumbler on my window-sill in order to see the issue
holding amicroscope to the first-mentioned red ant i saw that though he wasassiduously gnawing at the near fore-leg of his enemy having severedhis remaining feeler his own breast was all torn away exposing whatvitals he had there to the jaws of the black warrior whose breastplatewas apparently too thick for him to pierce and the dark carbuncles ofthe sufferer’s eyes shone with ferocity such as war only could excite
they struggled half an hour longer under the tumbler and when i lookedagain the black soldier had severed the heads of his foes from theirbodies and the still living heads were hanging on either side of himlike ghastly trophies at his saddle-bow still apparently as firmlyfastened as ever and he was endeavoring with feeble struggles beingwithout feelers and with only the remnant of a leg and i know not howmany other wounds to divest himself of them which at length afterhalf an hour more he accomplished
i raised the glass and he went offover the window-sill in that crippled state
whether he finallysurvived that combat and spent the remainder of his days in some hoteldes invalides i do not know but i thought that his industry would notbe worth much thereafter
i never learned which party was victoriousnor the cause of the war but i felt for the rest of that day as if ihad had my feelings excited and harrowed by witnessing the strugglethe ferocity and carnage of a human battle before my door
kirby and spence tell us that the battles of ants have long beencelebrated and the date of them recorded though they say that huber isthe only modern author who appears to have witnessed them
“æneassylvius” say they “after giving a very circumstantial account of onecontested with great obstinacy by a great and small species on thetrunk of a pear tree” adds that “‘this action was fought in thepontificate of eugenius the fourth in the presence of nicholaspistoriensis an eminent lawyer who related the whole history of thebattle with the greatest fidelity
’ a similar engagement between greatand small ants is recorded by olaus magnus in which the small onesbeing victorious are said to have buried the bodies of their ownsoldiers but left those of their giant enemies a prey to the birds
this event happened previous to the expulsion of the tyrant christiernthe second from sweden
” the battle which i witnessed took place in thepresidency of polk five years before the passage of webster’sfugitive-slave bill
many a village bose fit only to course a mud-turtle in a victuallingcellar sported his heavy quarters in the woods without the knowledgeof his master and ineffectually smelled at old fox burrows andwoodchucks’ holes led perchance by some slight cur which nimblythreaded the wood and might still inspire a natural terror in itsdenizens—now far behind his guide barking like a canine bull towardsome small squirrel which had treed itself for scrutiny thencantering off bending the bushes with his weight imagining that he ison the track of some stray member of the jerbilla family
once i wassurprised to see a cat walking along the stony shore of the pond forthey rarely wander so far from home
the surprise was mutual
nevertheless the most domestic cat which has lain on a rug all herdays appears quite at home in the woods and by her sly and stealthybehavior proves herself more native there than the regularinhabitants
once when berrying i met with a cat with young kittensin the woods quite wild and they all like their mother had theirbacks up and were fiercely spitting at me
a few years before i livedin the woods there was what was called a “winged cat” in one of thefarm-houses in lincoln nearest the pond mr
gilian baker’s
when icalled to see her in june 1842 she was gone a-hunting in the woodsas was her wont (i am not sure whether it was a male or female and souse the more common pronoun) but her mistress told me that she cameinto the neighborhood a little more than a year before in april andwas finally taken into their house that she was of a darkbrownish-gray color with a white spot on her throat and white feetand had a large bushy tail like a fox that in the winter the fur grewthick and flatted out along her sides forming stripes ten or twelveinches long by two and a half wide and under her chin like a muff theupper side loose the under matted like felt and in the spring theseappendages dropped off
they gave me a pair of her “wings” which ikeep still
there is no appearance of a membrane about them
somethought it was part flying-squirrel or some other wild animal which isnot impossible for according to naturalists prolific hybrids havebeen produced by the union of the marten and domestic cat
this wouldhave been the right kind of cat for me to keep if i had kept any forwhy should not a poet’s cat be winged as well as his horse
in the fall the loon (_colymbus glacialis_) came as usual to moultand bathe in the pond making the woods ring with his wild laughterbefore i had risen
at rumor of his arrival all the mill-dam sportsmenare on the alert in gigs and on foot two by two and three by threewith patent rifles and conical balls and spy-glasses
they comerustling through the woods like autumn leaves at least ten men to oneloon
some station themselves on this side of the pond some on thatfor the poor bird cannot be omnipresent if he dive here he must comeup there
but now the kind october wind rises rustling the leaves andrippling the surface of the water so that no loon can be heard orseen though his foes sweep the pond with spy-glasses and make thewoods resound with their discharges
the waves generously rise and dashangrily taking sides with all water-fowl and our sportsmen must beata retreat to town and shop and unfinished jobs
but they were too oftensuccessful
when i went to get a pail of water early in the morning ifrequently saw this stately bird sailing out of my cove within a fewrods
if i endeavored to overtake him in a boat in order to see how hewould manœuvre he would dive and be completely lost so that i did notdiscover him again sometimes till the latter part of the day
but iwas more than a match for him on the surface
he commonly went off in arain
as i was paddling along the north shore one very calm octoberafternoon for such days especially they settle on to the lakes likethe milkweed down having looked in vain over the pond for a loonsuddenly one sailing out from the shore toward the middle a few rodsin front of me set up his wild laugh and betrayed himself
i pursuedwith a paddle and he dived but when he came up i was nearer thanbefore
he dived again but i miscalculated the direction he wouldtake and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface thistime for i had helped to widen the interval and again he laughed longand loud and with more reason than before
he manœuvred so cunninglythat i could not get within half a dozen rods of him
each time whenhe came to the surface turning his head this way and that he coolysurveyed the water and the land and apparently chose his course sothat he might come up where there was the widest expanse of water andat the greatest distance from the boat
it was surprising how quicklyhe made up his mind and put his resolve into execution
he led me atonce to the widest part of the pond and could not be driven from it
while he was thinking one thing in his brain i was endeavoring todivine his thought in mine
it was a pretty game played on the smoothsurface of the pond a man against a loon
suddenly your adversary’schecker disappears beneath the board and the problem is to place yoursnearest to where his will appear again
sometimes he would come upunexpectedly on the opposite side of me having apparently passeddirectly under the boat
so long-winded was he and so unweariable thatwhen he had swum farthest he would immediately plunge againnevertheless and then no wit could divine where in the deep pondbeneath the smooth surface he might be speeding his way like a fishfor he had time and ability to visit the bottom of the pond in itsdeepest part
it is said that loons have been caught in the new yorklakes eighty feet beneath the surface with hooks set for trout—thoughwalden is deeper than that
how surprised must the fishes be to seethis ungainly visitor from another sphere speeding his way amid theirschools
yet he appeared to know his course as surely under water as onthe surface and swam much faster there
once or twice i saw a ripplewhere he approached the surface just put his head out to reconnoitreand instantly dived again
i found that it was as well for me to reston my oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate wherehe would rise for again and again when i was straining my eyes overthe surface one way i would suddenly be startled by his unearthlylaugh behind me
but why after displaying so much cunning did heinvariably betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh
didnot his white breast enough betray him
he was indeed a silly loon ithought
i could commonly hear the splash of the water when he came upand so also detected him
but after an hour he seemed as fresh as everdived as willingly and swam yet farther than at first
it wassurprising to see how serenely he sailed off with unruffled breast whenhe came to the surface doing all the work with his webbed feetbeneath
his usual note was this demoniac laughter yet somewhat likethat of a water-fowl but occasionally when he had balked me mostsuccessfully and come up a long way off he uttered a long-drawnunearthly howl probably more like that of a wolf than any bird aswhen a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and deliberately howls
thiswas his looning—perhaps the wildest sound that is ever heard heremaking the woods ring far and wide
i concluded that he laughed inderision of my efforts confident of his own resources
though the skywas by this time overcast the pond was so smooth that i could seewhere he broke the surface when i did not hear him
his white breastthe stillness of the air and the smoothness of the water were allagainst him
at length having come up fifty rods off he uttered oneof those prolonged howls as if calling on the god of loons to aid himand immediately there came a wind from the east and rippled thesurface and filled the whole air with misty rain and i was impressedas if it were the prayer of the loon answered and his god was angrywith me and so i left him disappearing far away on the tumultuoussurface
for hours in fall days i watched the ducks cunningly tack and veerand hold the middle of the pond far from the sportsman tricks whichthey will have less need to practise in louisiana bayous
whencompelled to rise they would sometimes circle round and round and overthe pond at a considerable height from which they could easily see toother ponds and the river like black motes in the sky and when ithought they had gone off thither long since they would settle down bya slanting flight of a quarter of a mile on to a distant part which wasleft free but what beside safety they got by sailing in the middle ofwalden i do not know unless they love its water for the same reasonthat i do
house-warmingin october i went a-graping to the river meadows and loaded myselfwith clusters more precious for their beauty and fragrance than forfood
there too i admired though i did not gather the cranberriessmall waxen gems pendants of the meadow grass pearly and red whichthe farmer plucks with an ugly rake leaving the smooth meadow in asnarl heedlessly measuring them by the bushel and the dollar only andsells the spoils of the meads to boston and new york destined to be_jammed_ to satisfy the tastes of lovers of nature there
so butchersrake the tongues of bison out of the prairie grass regardless of thetorn and drooping plant
the barberry’s brilliant fruit was likewisefood for my eyes merely but i collected a small store of wild applesfor coddling which the proprietor and travellers had overlooked
whenchestnuts were ripe i laid up half a bushel for winter
it was veryexciting at that season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods oflincoln—they now sleep their long sleep under the railroad—with a bagon my shoulder and a stick to open burrs with in my hand for i didnot always wait for the frost amid the rustling of leaves and the loudreproofs of the red-squirrels and the jays whose half-consumed nuts isometimes stole for the burrs which they had selected were sure tocontain sound ones
occasionally i climbed and shook the trees
theygrew also behind my house and one large tree which almostovershadowed it was when in flower a bouquet which scented the wholeneighborhood but the squirrels and the jays got most of its fruit thelast coming in flocks early in the morning and picking the nuts out ofthe burrs before they fell
i relinquished these trees to them andvisited the more distant woods composed wholly of chestnut
these nutsas far as they went were a good substitute for bread
many othersubstitutes might perhaps be found
digging one day for fish-worms idiscovered the ground-nut (_apios tuberosa_) on its string the potatoof the aborigines a sort of fabulous fruit which i had begun to doubtif i had ever dug and eaten in childhood as i had told and had notdreamed it
i had often since seen its crimpled red velvety blossomsupported by the stems of other plants without knowing it to be thesame
cultivation has well nigh exterminated it
it has a sweetishtaste much like that of a frostbitten potato and i found it betterboiled than roasted
this tuber seemed like a faint promise of natureto rear her own children and feed them simply here at some futureperiod
in these days of fatted cattle and waving grain-fields thishumble root which was once the _totem_ of an indian tribe is quiteforgotten or known only by its flowering vine but let wild naturereign here once more and the tender and luxurious english grains willprobably disappear before a myriad of foes and without the care of manthe crow may carry back even the last seed of corn to the greatcornfield of the indian’s god in the south-west whence he is said tohave brought it but the now almost exterminated ground-nut willperhaps revive and flourish in spite of frosts and wildness proveitself indigenous and resume its ancient importance and dignity as thediet of the hunter tribe
some indian ceres or minerva must have beenthe inventor and bestower of it and when the reign of poetry commenceshere its leaves and string of nuts may be represented on our works ofart
already by the first of september i had seen two or three smallmaples turned scarlet across the pond beneath where the white stems ofthree aspens diverged at the point of a promontory next the water
ah many a tale their color told
and gradually from week to week thecharacter of each tree came out and it admired itself reflected in thesmooth mirror of the lake
each morning the manager of this gallerysubstituted some new picture distinguished by more brilliant orharmonious coloring for the old upon the walls
the wasps came by thousands to my lodge in october as to winterquarters and settled on my windows within and on the walls over-headsometimes deterring visitors from entering
each morning when theywere numbed with cold i swept some of them out but i did not troublemyself much to get rid of them i even felt complimented by theirregarding my house as a desirable shelter
they never molested meseriously though they bedded with me and they gradually disappearedinto what crevices i do not know avoiding winter and unspeakable cold
like the wasps before i finally went into winter quarters in novemberi used to resort to the north-east side of walden which the sunreflected from the pitch-pine woods and the stony shore made thefire-side of the pond it is so much pleasanter and wholesomer to bewarmed by the sun while you can be than by an artificial fire
i thuswarmed myself by the still glowing embers which the summer like adeparted hunter had left
when i came to build my chimney i studied masonry
my bricks beingsecond-hand ones required to be cleaned with a trowel so that ilearned more than usual of the qualities of bricks and trowels
themortar on them was fifty years old and was said to be still growingharder but this is one of those sayings which men love to repeatwhether they are true or not
such sayings themselves grow harder andadhere more firmly with age and it would take many blows with a trowelto clean an old wiseacre of them
many of the villages of mesopotamiaare built of second-hand bricks of a very good quality obtained fromthe ruins of babylon and the cement on them is older and probablyharder still
however that may be i was struck by the peculiartoughness of the steel which bore so many violent blows without beingworn out
as my bricks had been in a chimney before though i did notread the name of nebuchadnezzar on them i picked out as manyfire-place bricks as i could find to save work and waste and i filledthe spaces between the bricks about the fire-place with stones from thepond shore and also made my mortar with the white sand from the sameplace
i lingered most about the fireplace as the most vital part ofthe house
indeed i worked so deliberately that though i commenced atthe ground in the morning a course of bricks raised a few inches abovethe floor served for my pillow at night yet i did not get a stiff neckfor it that i remember my stiff neck is of older date
i took a poetto board for a fortnight about those times which caused me to be putto it for room
he brought his own knife though i had two and we usedto scour them by thrusting them into the earth
he shared with me thelabors of cooking
i was pleased to see my work rising so square andsolid by degrees and reflected that if it proceeded slowly it wascalculated to endure a long time
the chimney is to some extent anindependent structure standing on the ground and rising through thehouse to the heavens even after the house is burned it still standssometimes and its importance and independence are apparent
this wastoward the end of summer
it was now november
the north wind had already begun to cool the pond though it took manyweeks of steady blowing to accomplish it it is so deep
when i beganto have a fire at evening before i plastered my house the chimneycarried smoke particularly well because of the numerous chinks betweenthe boards
yet i passed some cheerful evenings in that cool and airyapartment surrounded by the rough brown boards full of knots andrafters with the bark on high overhead
my house never pleased my eyeso much after it was plastered though i was obliged to confess that itwas more comfortable
should not every apartment in which man dwells belofty enough to create some obscurity over-head where flickeringshadows may play at evening about the rafters
these forms are moreagreeable to the fancy and imagination than fresco paintings or otherthe most expensive furniture
i now first began to inhabit my house imay say when i began to use it for warmth as well as shelter
i hadgot a couple of old fire-dogs to keep the wood from the hearth and itdid me good to see the soot form on the back of the chimney which i hadbuilt and i poked the fire with more right and more satisfaction thanusual
my dwelling was small and i could hardly entertain an echo init but it seemed larger for being a single apartment and remote fromneighbors
all the attractions of a house were concentrated in oneroom it was kitchen chamber parlor and keeping-room and whateversatisfaction parent or child master or servant derive from living ina house i enjoyed it all
cato says the master of a family(_patremfamilias_) must have in his rustic villa “cellam oleariamvinariam dolia multa uti lubeat caritatem expectare et rei etvirtuti et gloriæ erit” that is “an oil and wine cellar many casksso that it may be pleasant to expect hard times it will be for hisadvantage and virtue and glory
” i had in my cellar a firkin ofpotatoes about two quarts of peas with the weevil in them and on myshelf a little rice a jug of molasses and of rye and indian meal apeck each
i sometimes dream of a larger and more populous house standing in agolden age of enduring materials and without ginger-bread work whichshall still consist of only one room a vast rude substantialprimitive hall without ceiling or plastering with bare rafters andpurlins supporting a sort of lower heaven over one’s head—useful tokeep off rain and snow where the king and queen posts stand out toreceive your homage when you have done reverence to the prostratesaturn of an older dynasty on stepping over the sill a cavernoushouse wherein you must reach up a torch upon a pole to see the roofwhere some may live in the fire-place some in the recess of a windowand some on settles some at one end of the hall some at another andsome aloft on rafters with the spiders if they choose a house whichyou have got into when you have opened the outside door and theceremony is over where the weary traveller may wash and eat andconverse and sleep without further journey such a shelter as youwould be glad to reach in a tempestuous night containing all theessentials of a house and nothing for house-keeping where you can seeall the treasures of the house at one view and every thing hangs uponits peg that a man should use at once kitchen pantry parlorchamber store-house and garret where you can see so necessary athing as a barrel or a ladder so convenient a thing as a cupboard andhear the pot boil and pay your respects to the fire that cooks yourdinner and the oven that bakes your bread and the necessary furnitureand utensils are the chief ornaments where the washing is not put outnor the fire nor the mistress and perhaps you are sometimes requestedto move from off the trap-door when the cook would descend into thecellar and so learn whether the ground is solid or hollow beneath youwithout stamping
a house whose inside is as open and manifest as abird’s nest and you cannot go in at the front door and out at the backwithout seeing some of its inhabitants where to be a guest is to bepresented with the freedom of the house and not to be carefullyexcluded from seven eighths of it shut up in a particular cell andtold to make yourself at home there—in solitary confinement
nowadaysthe host does not admit you to _his_ hearth but has got the mason tobuild one for yourself somewhere in his alley and hospitality is theart of _keeping_ you at the greatest distance
there is as much secrecyabout the cooking as if he had a design to poison you
i am aware thati have been on many a man’s premises and might have been legallyordered off but i am not aware that i have been in many men’s houses
i might visit in my old clothes a king and queen who lived simply insuch a house as i have described if i were going their way butbacking out of a modern palace will be all that i shall desire tolearn if ever i am caught in one
it would seem as if the very language of our parlors would lose all itsnerve and degenerate into _palaver_ wholly our lives pass at suchremoteness from its symbols and its metaphors and tropes arenecessarily so far fetched through slides and dumb-waiters as itwere in other words the parlor is so far from the kitchen andworkshop
the dinner even is only the parable of a dinner commonly
asif only the savage dwelt near enough to nature and truth to borrow atrope from them
how can the scholar who dwells away in the north westterritory or the isle of man tell what is parliamentary in thekitchen
however only one or two of my guests were ever bold enough to stay andeat a hasty-pudding with me but when they saw that crisis approachingthey beat a hasty retreat rather as if it would shake the house to itsfoundations
nevertheless it stood through a great manyhasty-puddings
i did not plaster till it was freezing weather
i brought over somewhiter and cleaner sand for this purpose from the opposite shore of thepond in a boat a sort of conveyance which would have tempted me to gomuch farther if necessary
my house had in the mean while been shingleddown to the ground on every side
in lathing i was pleased to be ableto send home each nail with a single blow of the hammer and it was myambition to transfer the plaster from the board to the wall neatly andrapidly
i remembered the story of a conceited fellow who in fineclothes was wont to lounge about the village once giving advice toworkmen
venturing one day to substitute deeds for words he turned uphis cuffs seized a plasterer’s board and having loaded his trowelwithout mishap with a complacent look toward the lathing overheadmade a bold gesture thitherward and straightway to his completediscomfiture received the whole contents in his ruffled bosom
iadmired anew the economy and convenience of plastering which soeffectually shuts out the cold and takes a handsome finish and ilearned the various casualties to which the plasterer is liable
i wassurprised to see how thirsty the bricks were which drank up all themoisture in my plaster before i had smoothed it and how many pailfulsof water it takes to christen a new hearth
i had the previous wintermade a small quantity of lime by burning the shells of the _uniofluviatilis_ which our river affords for the sake of the experimentso that i knew where my materials came from
i might have got goodlimestone within a mile or two and burned it myself if i had cared todo so
the pond had in the mean while skimmed over in the shadiest andshallowest coves some days or even weeks before the general freezing
the first ice is especially interesting and perfect being hard darkand transparent and affords the best opportunity that ever offers forexamining the bottom where it is shallow for you can lie at yourlength on ice only an inch thick like a skater insect on the surfaceof the water and study the bottom at your leisure only two or threeinches distant like a picture behind a glass and the water isnecessarily always smooth then
there are many furrows in the sandwhere some creature has travelled about and doubled on its tracks andfor wrecks it is strewn with the cases of cadis worms made of minutegrains of white quartz
perhaps these have creased it for you findsome of their cases in the furrows though they are deep and broad forthem to make
but the ice itself is the object of most interest thoughyou must improve the earliest opportunity to study it
if you examineit closely the morning after it freezes you find that the greater partof the bubbles which at first appeared to be within it are againstits under surface and that more are continually rising from thebottom while the ice is as yet comparatively solid and dark that isyou see the water through it
these bubbles are from an eightieth to aneighth of an inch in diameter very clear and beautiful and you seeyour face reflected in them through the ice
there may be thirty orforty of them to a square inch
there are also already within the icenarrow oblong perpendicular bubbles about half an inch long sharpcones with the apex upward or oftener if the ice is quite freshminute spherical bubbles one directly above another like a string ofbeads
but these within the ice are not so numerous nor obvious asthose beneath
i sometimes used to cast on stones to try the strengthof the ice and those which broke through carried in air with themwhich formed very large and conspicuous white bubbles beneath
one daywhen i came to the same place forty-eight hours afterward i found thatthose large bubbles were still perfect though an inch more of ice hadformed as i could see distinctly by the seam in the edge of a cake
but as the last two days had been very warm like an indian summer theice was not now transparent showing the dark green color of the waterand the bottom but opaque and whitish or gray and though twice asthick was hardly stronger than before for the air bubbles had greatlyexpanded under this heat and run together and lost their regularitythey were no longer one directly over another but often like silverycoins poured from a bag one overlapping another or in thin flakes asif occupying slight cleavages
the beauty of the ice was gone and itwas too late to study the bottom
being curious to know what positionmy great bubbles occupied with regard to the new ice i broke out acake containing a middling sized one and turned it bottom upward
thenew ice had formed around and under the bubble so that it was includedbetween the two ices
it was wholly in the lower ice but close againstthe upper and was flattish or perhaps slightly lenticular with arounded edge a quarter of an inch deep by four inches in diameter andi was surprised to find that directly under the bubble the ice wasmelted with great regularity in the form of a saucer reversed to theheight of five eighths of an inch in the middle leaving a thinpartition there between the water and the bubble hardly an eighth ofan inch thick and in many places the small bubbles in this partitionhad burst out downward and probably there was no ice at all under thelargest bubbles which were a foot in diameter
i inferred that theinfinite number of minute bubbles which i had first seen against theunder surface of the ice were now frozen in likewise and that each inits degree had operated like a burning glass on the ice beneath tomelt and rot it
these are the little air-guns which contribute to makethe ice crack and whoop
at length the winter set in in good earnest just as i had finishedplastering and the wind began to howl around the house as if it hadnot had permission to do so till then
night after night the geese camelumbering in in the dark with a clangor and a whistling of wings evenafter the ground was covered with snow some to alight in walden andsome flying low over the woods toward fair haven bound for mexico
several times when returning from the village at ten or eleven o’clockat night i heard the tread of a flock of geese or else ducks on thedry leaves in the woods by a pond-hole behind my dwelling where theyhad come up to feed and the faint honk or quack of their leader asthey hurried off
in 1845 walden froze entirely over for the first timeon the night of the 22d of december flint’s and other shallower pondsand the river having been frozen ten days or more in ’46 the 16th in’49 about the 31st and in ’50 about the 27th of december in ’52the 5th of january in ’53 the 31st of december
the snow had alreadycovered the ground since the 25th of november and surrounded mesuddenly with the scenery of winter
i withdrew yet farther into myshell and endeavored to keep a bright fire both within my house andwithin my breast
my employment out of doors now was to collect thedead wood in the forest bringing it in my hands or on my shoulders orsometimes trailing a dead pine tree under each arm to my shed
an oldforest fence which had seen its best days was a great haul for me
isacrificed it to vulcan for it was past serving the god terminus
howmuch more interesting an event is that man’s supper who has just beenforth in the snow to hunt nay you might say steal the fuel to cookit with
his bread and meat are sweet
there are enough fagots andwaste wood of all kinds in the forests of most of our towns to supportmany fires but which at present warm none and some think hinder thegrowth of the young wood
there was also the drift-wood of the pond
inthe course of the summer i had discovered a raft of pitch-pine logswith the bark on pinned together by the irish when the railroad wasbuilt
this i hauled up partly on the shore
after soaking two yearsand then lying high six months it was perfectly sound thoughwaterlogged past drying
i amused myself one winter day with slidingthis piecemeal across the pond nearly half a mile skating behind withone end of a log fifteen feet long on my shoulder and the other on theice or i tied several logs together with a birch withe and then witha longer birch or alder which had a hook at the end dragged themacross
though completely waterlogged and almost as heavy as lead theynot only burned long but made a very hot fire nay i thought thatthey burned better for the soaking as if the pitch being confined bythe water burned longer as in a lamp
gilpin in his account of the forest borderers of england says that“the encroachments of trespassers and the houses and fences thusraised on the borders of the forest” were “considered as greatnuisances by the old forest law and were severely punished under thename of _purprestures_ as tending _ad terrorem ferarum—ad nocumentumforestæ_ &c
” to the frightening of the game and the detriment of theforest
but i was interested in the preservation of the venison and thevert more than the hunters or woodchoppers and as much as though i hadbeen the lord warden himself and if any part was burned though iburned it myself by accident i grieved with a grief that lasted longerand was more inconsolable than that of the proprietors nay i grievedwhen it was cut down by the proprietors themselves
i would that ourfarmers when they cut down a forest felt some of that awe which the oldromans did when they came to thin or let in the light to aconsecrated grove (_lucum conlucare_) that is would believe that itis sacred to some god
the roman made an expiatory offering andprayed whatever god or goddess thou art to whom this grove is sacredbe propitious to me my family and children &c
it is remarkable what a value is still put upon wood even in this ageand in this new country a value more permanent and universal than thatof gold
after all our discoveries and inventions no man will go by apile of wood
it is as precious to us as it was to our saxon and normanancestors
if they made their bows of it we make our gun-stocks of it
michaux more than thirty years ago says that the price of wood forfuel in new york and philadelphia “nearly equals and sometimesexceeds that of the best wood in paris though this immense capitalannually requires more than three hundred thousand cords and issurrounded to the distance of three hundred miles by cultivatedplains
” in this town the price of wood rises almost steadily and theonly question is how much higher it is to be this year than it was thelast
mechanics and tradesmen who come in person to the forest on noother errand are sure to attend the wood auction and even pay a highprice for the privilege of gleaning after the woodchopper
it is nowmany years that men have resorted to the forest for fuel and thematerials of the arts the new englander and the new hollander theparisian and the celt the farmer and robinhood goody blake and harrygill in most parts of the world the prince and the peasant thescholar and the savage equally require still a few sticks from theforest to warm them and cook their food
neither could i do withoutthem
every man looks at his wood-pile with a kind of affection
i love tohave mine before my window and the more chips the better to remind meof my pleasing work
i had an old axe which nobody claimed with whichby spells in winter days on the sunny side of the house i playedabout the stumps which i had got out of my bean-field
as my driverprophesied when i was ploughing they warmed me twice once while i wassplitting them and again when they were on the fire so that no fuelcould give out more heat
as for the axe i was advised to get thevillage blacksmith to “jump” it but i jumped him and putting ahickory helve from the woods into it made it do
if it was dull itwas at least hung true
a few pieces of fat pine were a great treasure
it is interesting toremember how much of this food for fire is still concealed in thebowels of the earth
in previous years i had often gone “prospecting”over some bare hill-side where a pitch-pine wood had formerly stoodand got out the fat pine roots
they are almost indestructible
stumpsthirty or forty years old at least will still be sound at the corethough the sapwood has all become vegetable mould as appears by thescales of the thick bark forming a ring level with the earth four orfive inches distant from the heart
with axe and shovel you explorethis mine and follow the marrowy store yellow as beef tallow or asif you had struck on a vein of gold deep into the earth
but commonlyi kindled my fire with the dry leaves of the forest which i had storedup in my shed before the snow came
green hickory finely split makesthe woodchopper’s kindlings when he has a camp in the woods
once in awhile i got a little of this
when the villagers were lighting theirfires beyond the horizon i too gave notice to the various wildinhabitants of walden vale by a smoky streamer from my chimney that iwas awake
—     light-winged smoke icarian bird     melting thy pinions in thy upward flight     lark without song and messenger of dawn     circling above the hamlets as thy nest     or else departing dream and shadowy form     of midnight vision gathering up thy skirts     by night star-veiling and by day     darkening the light and blotting out the sun     go thou my incense upward from this hearth     and ask the gods to pardon this clear flame
hard green wood just cut though i used but little of that answered mypurpose better than any other
i sometimes left a good fire when i wentto take a walk in a winter afternoon and when i returned three orfour hours afterward it would be still alive and glowing
my house wasnot empty though i was gone
it was as if i had left a cheerfulhousekeeper behind
it was i and fire that lived there and commonly myhousekeeper proved trustworthy
one day however as i was splittingwood i thought that i would just look in at the window and see if thehouse was not on fire it was the only time i remember to have beenparticularly anxious on this score so i looked and saw that a sparkhad caught my bed and i went in and extinguished it when it had burneda place as big as my hand
but my house occupied so sunny and sheltereda position and its roof was so low that i could afford to let thefire go out in the middle of almost any winter day
the moles nested in my cellar nibbling every third potato and makinga snug bed even there of some hair left after plastering and of brownpaper for even the wildest animals love comfort and warmth as well asman and they survive the winter only because they are so careful tosecure them
some of my friends spoke as if i was coming to the woodson purpose to freeze myself
the animal merely makes a bed which hewarms with his body in a sheltered place but man having discoveredfire boxes up some air in a spacious apartment and warms thatinstead of robbing himself makes that his bed in which he can moveabout divested of more cumbrous clothing maintain a kind of summer inthe midst of winter and by means of windows even admit the light andwith a lamp lengthen out the day
thus he goes a step or two beyondinstinct and saves a little time for the fine arts
though when i hadbeen exposed to the rudest blasts a long time my whole body began togrow torpid when i reached the genial atmosphere of my house i soonrecovered my faculties and prolonged my life
but the most luxuriouslyhoused has little to boast of in this respect nor need we troubleourselves to speculate how the human race may be at last destroyed
itwould be easy to cut their threads any time with a little sharper blastfrom the north
we go on dating from cold fridays and great snows buta little colder friday or greater snow would put a period to man’sexistence on the globe
the next winter i used a small cooking-stove for economy since i didnot own the forest but it did not keep fire so well as the openfire-place
cooking was then for the most part no longer a poeticbut merely a chemic process
it will soon be forgotten in these daysof stoves that we used to roast potatoes in the ashes after theindian fashion
the stove not only took up room and scented the housebut it concealed the fire and i felt as if i had lost a companion
youcan always see a face in the fire
the laborer looking into it atevening purifies his thoughts of the dross and earthiness which theyhave accumulated during the day
but i could no longer sit and lookinto the fire and the pertinent words of a poet recurred to me withnew force
—     “never bright flame may be denied to me     thy dear life imaging close sympathy
what but my hopes shot upward e’er so bright
what but my fortunes sunk so low in night
why art thou banished from our hearth and hall     thou who art welcomed and beloved by all
was thy existence then too fanciful     for our life’s common light who are so dull
did thy bright gleam mysterious converse hold     with our congenial souls
secrets too bold
well we are safe and strong for now we sit     beside a hearth where no dim shadows flit     where nothing cheers nor saddens but a fire     warms feet and hands—nor does to more aspire     by whose compact utilitarian heap     the present may sit down and go to sleep     nor fear the ghosts who from the dim past walked     and with us by the unequal light of the old wood fire talked
”former inhabitants and winter visitorsi weathered some merry snow storms and spent some cheerful winterevenings by my fire-side while the snow whirled wildly without andeven the hooting of the owl was hushed
for many weeks i met no one inmy walks but those who came occasionally to cut wood and sled it to thevillage
the elements however abetted me in making a path through thedeepest snow in the woods for when i had once gone through the windblew the oak leaves into my tracks where they lodged and by absorbingthe rays of the sun melted the snow and so not only made a dry bed formy feet but in the night their dark line was my guide
for humansociety i was obliged to conjure up the former occupants of thesewoods
within the memory of many of my townsmen the road near which myhouse stands resounded with the laugh and gossip of inhabitants andthe woods which border it were notched and dotted here and there withtheir little gardens and dwellings though it was then much more shutin by the forest than now
in some places within my own remembrancethe pines would scrape both sides of a chaise at once and women andchildren who were compelled to go this way to lincoln alone and on footdid it with fear and often ran a good part of the distance
thoughmainly but a humble route to neighboring villages or for the woodman’steam it once amused the traveller more than now by its variety andlingered longer in his memory
where now firm open fields stretch fromthe village to the woods it then ran through a maple swamp on afoundation of logs the remnants of which doubtless still underliethe present dusty highway from the stratton now the alms house farmto brister’s hill
east of my bean-field across the road lived cato ingraham slave ofduncan ingraham esquire gentleman of concord village who built hisslave a house and gave him permission to live in walden woods—catonot uticensis but concordiensis
some say that he was a guinea negro
there are a few who remember his little patch among the walnuts whichhe let grow up till he should be old and need them but a younger andwhiter speculator got them at last
he too however occupies anequally narrow house at present
cato’s half-obliterated cellar holestill remains though known to few being concealed from the travellerby a fringe of pines
it is now filled with the smooth sumach (_rhusglabra_) and one of the earliest species of golden-rod (_solidagostricta_) grows there luxuriantly
here by the very corner of my field still nearer to town zilpha acolored woman had her little house where she spun linen for thetownsfolk making the walden woods ring with her shrill singing forshe had a loud and notable voice
at length in the war of 1812 herdwelling was set on fire by english soldiers prisoners on parole whenshe was away and her cat and dog and hens were all burned up together
she led a hard life and somewhat inhumane
one old frequenter of thesewoods remembers that as he passed her house one noon he heard hermuttering to herself over her gurgling pot—“ye are all bones bones
”i have seen bricks amid the oak copse there
down the road on the right hand on brister’s hill lived bristerfreeman “a handy negro” slave of squire cummings once—there wheregrow still the apple-trees which brister planted and tended large oldtrees now but their fruit still wild and ciderish to my taste
notlong since i read his epitaph in the old lincoln burying-ground alittle on one side near the unmarked graves of some british grenadierswho fell in the retreat from concord—where he is styled “sippiobrister”—scipio africanus he had some title to be called—“a man ofcolor” as if he were discolored
it also told me with staringemphasis when he died which was but an indirect way of informing methat he ever lived
with him dwelt fenda his hospitable wife who toldfortunes yet pleasantly—large round and black blacker than any ofthe children of night such a dusky orb as never rose on concord beforeor since
farther down the hill on the left on the old road in the woods aremarks of some homestead of the stratton family whose orchard oncecovered all the slope of brister’s hill but was long since killed outby pitch pines excepting a few stumps whose old roots furnish stillthe wild stocks of many a thrifty village tree
nearer yet to town you come to breed’s location on the other side ofthe way just on the edge of the wood ground famous for the pranks ofa demon not distinctly named in old mythology who has acted aprominent and astounding part in our new england life and deserves asmuch as any mythological character to have his biography written oneday who first comes in the guise of a friend or hired man and thenrobs and murders the whole family—new-england rum
but history mustnot yet tell the tragedies enacted here let time intervene in somemeasure to assuage and lend an azure tint to them
here the mostindistinct and dubious tradition says that once a tavern stood thewell the same which tempered the traveller’s beverage and refreshedhis steed
here then men saluted one another and heard and told thenews and went their ways again
breed’s hut was standing only a dozen years ago though it had longbeen unoccupied
it was about the size of mine
it was set on fire bymischievous boys one election night if i do not mistake
i lived onthe edge of the village then and had just lost myself over davenant’sgondibert that winter that i labored with a lethargy—which by theway i never knew whether to regard as a family complaint having anuncle who goes to sleep shaving himself and is obliged to sproutpotatoes in a cellar sundays in order to keep awake and keep thesabbath or as the consequence of my attempt to read chalmers’collection of english poetry without skipping
it fairly overcame mynervii
i had just sunk my head on this when the bells rung fire andin hot haste the engines rolled that way led by a straggling troop ofmen and boys and i among the foremost for i had leaped the brook
wethought it was far south over the woods—we who had run to firesbefore—barn shop or dwelling-house or all together
“it’s baker’sbarn” cried one
“it is the codman place” affirmed another
and thenfresh sparks went up above the wood as if the roof fell in and we allshouted “concord to the rescue
” wagons shot past with furious speedand crushing loads bearing perchance among the rest the agent ofthe insurance company who was bound to go however far and ever andanon the engine bell tinkled behind more slow and sure and rearmostof all as it was afterward whispered came they who set the fire andgave the alarm
thus we kept on like true idealists rejecting theevidence of our senses until at a turn in the road we heard thecrackling and actually felt the heat of the fire from over the walland realized alas
that we were there
the very nearness of the firebut cooled our ardor
at first we thought to throw a frog-pond on toit but concluded to let it burn it was so far gone and so worthless
so we stood round our engine jostled one another expressed oursentiments through speaking-trumpets or in lower tone referred to thegreat conflagrations which the world has witnessed including bascom’sshop and between ourselves we thought that were we there in seasonwith our “tub” and a full frog-pond by we could turn that threatenedlast and universal one into another flood
we finally retreated withoutdoing any mischief—returned to sleep and gondibert
but as forgondibert i would except that passage in the preface about wit beingthe soul’s powder—“but most of mankind are strangers to wit asindians are to powder
”it chanced that i walked that way across the fields the followingnight about the same hour and hearing a low moaning at this spot idrew near in the dark and discovered the only survivor of the familythat i know the heir of both its virtues and its vices who alone wasinterested in this burning lying on his stomach and looking over thecellar wall at the still smouldering cinders beneath muttering tohimself as is his wont
he had been working far off in the rivermeadows all day and had improved the first moments that he could callhis own to visit the home of his fathers and his youth
he gazed intothe cellar from all sides and points of view by turns always lyingdown to it as if there was some treasure which he rememberedconcealed between the stones where there was absolutely nothing but aheap of bricks and ashes
the house being gone he looked at what therewas left
he was soothed by the sympathy which my mere presenceimplied and showed me as well as the darkness permitted where thewell was covered up which thank heaven could never be burned and hegroped long about the wall to find the well-sweep which his father hadcut and mounted feeling for the iron hook or staple by which a burdenhad been fastened to the heavy end—all that he could now cling to—toconvince me that it was no common “rider
” i felt it and still remarkit almost daily in my walks for by it hangs the history of a family
once more on the left where are seen the well and lilac bushes by thewall in the now open field lived nutting and le grosse
but to returntoward lincoln
farther in the woods than any of these where the road approachesnearest to the pond wyman the potter squatted and furnished histownsmen with earthen ware and left descendants to succeed him
neither were they rich in worldly goods holding the land by sufferancewhile they lived and there often the sheriff came in vain to collectthe taxes and “attached a chip” for form’s sake as i have read inhis accounts there being nothing else that he could lay his hands on
one day in midsummer when i was hoeing a man who was carrying a loadof pottery to market stopped his horse against my field and inquiredconcerning wyman the younger
he had long ago bought a potter’s wheelof him and wished to know what had become of him
i had read of thepotter’s clay and wheel in scripture but it had never occurred to methat the pots we use were not such as had come down unbroken from thosedays or grown on trees like gourds somewhere and i was pleased tohear that so fictile an art was ever practiced in my neighborhood
the last inhabitant of these woods before me was an irishman hughquoil (if i have spelt his name with coil enough) who occupied wyman’stenement—col
quoil he was called
rumor said that he had been asoldier at waterloo
if he had lived i should have made him fight hisbattles over again
his trade here was that of a ditcher
napoleon wentto st
helena quoil came to walden woods
all i know of him is tragic
he was a man of manners like one who had seen the world and wascapable of more civil speech than you could well attend to
he wore agreat coat in mid-summer being affected with the trembling deliriumand his face was the color of carmine
he died in the road at the footof brister’s hill shortly after i came to the woods so that i have notremembered him as a neighbor
before his house was pulled down whenhis comrades avoided it as “an unlucky castle” i visited it
there layhis old clothes curled up by use as if they were himself upon hisraised plank bed
his pipe lay broken on the hearth instead of a bowlbroken at the fountain
the last could never have been the symbol ofhis death for he confessed to me that though he had heard ofbrister’s spring he had never seen it and soiled cards kings ofdiamonds spades and hearts were scattered over the floor
one blackchicken which the administrator could not catch black as night and assilent not even croaking awaiting reynard still went to roost in thenext apartment
in the rear there was the dim outline of a gardenwhich had been planted but had never received its first hoeing owingto those terrible shaking fits though it was now harvest time
it wasover-run with roman wormwood and beggar-ticks which last stuck to myclothes for all fruit
the skin of a woodchuck was freshly stretchedupon the back of the house a trophy of his last waterloo but no warmcap or mittens would he want more
now only a dent in the earth marks the site of these dwellings withburied cellar stones and strawberries raspberries thimble-berrieshazel-bushes and sumachs growing in the sunny sward there somepitch-pine or gnarled oak occupies what was the chimney nook and asweet-scented black-birch perhaps waves where the door-stone was
sometimes the well dent is visible where once a spring oozed now dryand tearless grass or it was covered deep—not to be discovered tillsome late day—with a flat stone under the sod when the last of therace departed
what a sorrowful act must that be—the covering up ofwells
coincident with the opening of wells of tears
these cellardents like deserted fox burrows old holes are all that is left whereonce were the stir and bustle of human life and “fate free-willforeknowledge absolute” in some form and dialect or other were byturns discussed
but all i can learn of their conclusions amounts tojust this that “cato and brister pulled wool” which is about asedifying as the history of more famous schools of philosophy
still grows the vivacious lilac a generation after the door and linteland the sill are gone unfolding its sweet-scented flowers each springto be plucked by the musing traveller planted and tended once bychildren’s hands in front-yard plots—now standing by wall-sides inretired pastures and giving place to new-rising forests—the last ofthat stirp sole survivor of that family
little did the dusky childrenthink that the puny slip with its two eyes only which they stuck inthe ground in the shadow of the house and daily watered would rootitself so and outlive them and house itself in the rear that shadedit and grown man’s garden and orchard and tell their story faintly tothe lone wanderer a half century after they had grown up anddied—blossoming as fair and smelling as sweet as in that firstspring
i mark its still tender civil cheerful lilac colors
but this small village germ of something more why did it fail whileconcord keeps its ground
were there no natural advantages—no waterprivileges forsooth
ay the deep walden pond and cool brister’sspring—privilege to drink long and healthy draughts at these allunimproved by these men but to dilute their glass
they wereuniversally a thirsty race
might not the basket stable-broommat-making corn-parching linen-spinning and pottery business havethrived here making the wilderness to blossom like the rose and anumerous posterity have inherited the land of their fathers
thesterile soil would at least have been proof against a low-landdegeneracy
alas
how little does the memory of these human inhabitantsenhance the beauty of the landscape
again perhaps nature will trywith me for a first settler and my house raised last spring to be theoldest in the hamlet
i am not aware that any man has ever built on the spot which i occupy
deliver me from a city built on the site of a more ancient city whosematerials are ruins whose gardens cemeteries
the soil is blanched andaccursed there and before that becomes necessary the earth itself willbe destroyed
with such reminiscences i repeopled the woods and lulledmyself asleep
at this season i seldom had a visitor
when the snow lay deepest nowanderer ventured near my house for a week or fortnight at a time butthere i lived as snug as a meadow mouse or as cattle and poultry whichare said to have survived for a long time buried in drifts evenwithout food or like that early settler’s family in the town ofsutton in this state whose cottage was completely covered by thegreat snow of 1717 when he was absent and an indian found it only bythe hole which the chimney’s breath made in the drift and so relievedthe family
but no friendly indian concerned himself about me norneeded he for the master of the house was at home
the great snow
howcheerful it is to hear of
when the farmers could not get to the woodsand swamps with their teams and were obliged to cut down the shadetrees before their houses and when the crust was harder cut off thetrees in the swamps ten feet from the ground as it appeared the nextspring
in the deepest snows the path which i used from the highway to myhouse about half a mile long might have been represented by ameandering dotted line with wide intervals between the dots
for aweek of even weather i took exactly the same number of steps and ofthe same length coming and going stepping deliberately and with theprecision of a pair of dividers in my own deep tracks—to such routinethe winter reduces us—yet often they were filled with heaven’s ownblue
but no weather interfered fatally with my walks or rather mygoing abroad for i frequently tramped eight or ten miles through thedeepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech-tree or ayellow-birch or an old acquaintance among the pines when the ice andsnow causing their limbs to droop and so sharpening their tops hadchanged the pines into fir-trees wading to the tops of the highesthills when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level and shakingdown another snow-storm on my head at every step or sometimes creepingand floundering thither on my hands and knees when the hunters hadgone into winter quarters
one afternoon i amused myself by watching abarred owl (_strix nebulosa_) sitting on one of the lower dead limbs ofa white-pine close to the trunk in broad daylight i standing withina rod of him
he could hear me when i moved and cronched the snow withmy feet but could not plainly see me
when i made most noise he wouldstretch out his neck and erect his neck feathers and open his eyeswide but their lids soon fell again and he began to nod
i too felt aslumberous influence after watching him half an hour as he sat thuswith his eyes half open like a cat winged brother of the cat
therewas only a narrow slit left between their lids by which he preserved apeninsular relation to me thus with half-shut eyes looking out fromthe land of dreams and endeavoring to realize me vague object or motethat interrupted his visions
at length on some louder noise or mynearer approach he would grow uneasy and sluggishly turn about on hisperch as if impatient at having his dreams disturbed and when helaunched himself off and flapped through the pines spreading his wingsto unexpected breadth i could not hear the slightest sound from them
thus guided amid the pine boughs rather by a delicate sense of theirneighborhood than by sight feeling his twilight way as it were withhis sensitive pinions he found a new perch where he might in peaceawait the dawning of his day
as i walked over the long causeway made for the railroad through themeadows i encountered many a blustering and nipping wind for nowherehas it freer play and when the frost had smitten me on one cheekheathen as i was i turned to it the other also
nor was it much betterby the carriage road from brister’s hill
for i came to town stilllike a friendly indian when the contents of the broad open fields wereall piled up between the walls of the walden road and half an hoursufficed to obliterate the tracks of the last traveller
and when ireturned new drifts would have formed through which i flounderedwhere the busy north-west wind had been depositing the powdery snowround a sharp angle in the road and not a rabbit’s track nor even thefine print the small type of a meadow mouse was to be seen
yet irarely failed to find even in mid-winter some warm and springly swampwhere the grass and the skunk-cabbage still put forth with perennialverdure and some hardier bird occasionally awaited the return ofspring
sometimes notwithstanding the snow when i returned from my walk atevening i crossed the deep tracks of a woodchopper leading from mydoor and found his pile of whittlings on the hearth and my housefilled with the odor of his pipe
or on a sunday afternoon if ichanced to be at home i heard the cronching of the snow made by thestep of a long-headed farmer who from far through the woods sought myhouse to have a social “crack” one of the few of his vocation who are“men on their farms” who donned a frock instead of a professor’s gownand is as ready to extract the moral out of church or state as to haula load of manure from his barn-yard
we talked of rude and simpletimes when men sat about large fires in cold bracing weather withclear heads and when other dessert failed we tried our teeth on manya nut which wise squirrels have long since abandoned for those whichhave the thickest shells are commonly empty
the one who came from farthest to my lodge through deepest snows andmost dismal tempests was a poet
a farmer a hunter a soldier areporter even a philosopher may be daunted but nothing can deter apoet for he is actuated by pure love
who can predict his comings andgoings
his business calls him out at all hours even when doctorssleep
we made that small house ring with boisterous mirth and resoundwith the murmur of much sober talk making amends then to walden valefor the long silences
broadway was still and deserted in comparison
at suitable intervals there were regular salutes of laughter whichmight have been referred indifferently to the last uttered or theforth-coming jest
we made many a “bran new” theory of life over a thindish of gruel which combined the advantages of conviviality with theclear-headedness which philosophy requires
i should not forget that during my last winter at the pond there wasanother welcome visitor who at one time came through the villagethrough snow and rain and darkness till he saw my lamp through thetrees and shared with me some long winter evenings
one of the last ofthe philosophers—connecticut gave him to the world—he peddled firsther wares afterwards as he declares his brains
these he peddlesstill prompting god and disgracing man bearing for fruit his brainonly like the nut its kernel
i think that he must be the man of themost faith of any alive
his words and attitude always suppose a betterstate of things than other men are acquainted with and he will be thelast man to be disappointed as the ages revolve
he has no venture inthe present
but though comparatively disregarded now when his daycomes laws unsuspected by most will take effect and masters offamilies and rulers will come to him for advice
—     “how blind that cannot see serenity
”a true friend of man almost the only friend of human progress
an oldmortality say rather an immortality with unwearied patience and faithmaking plain the image engraven in men’s bodies the god of whom theyare but defaced and leaning monuments
with his hospitable intellect heembraces children beggars insane and scholars and entertains thethought of all adding to it commonly some breadth and elegance
ithink that he should keep a caravansary on the world’s highway wherephilosophers of all nations might put up and on his sign should beprinted “entertainment for man but not for his beast
enter ye thathave leisure and a quiet mind who earnestly seek the right road
” heis perhaps the sanest man and has the fewest crotchets of any i chanceto know the same yesterday and tomorrow
of yore we had sauntered andtalked and effectually put the world behind us for he was pledged tono institution in it freeborn _ingenuus_
whichever way we turned itseemed that the heavens and the earth had met together since heenhanced the beauty of the landscape
a blue-robed man whose fittestroof is the overarching sky which reflects his serenity
i do not seehow he can ever die nature cannot spare him
having each some shingles of thought well dried we sat and whittledthem trying our knives and admiring the clear yellowish grain of thepumpkin pine
we waded so gently and reverently or we pulled togetherso smoothly that the fishes of thought were not scared from thestream nor feared any angler on the bank but came and went grandlylike the clouds which float through the western sky and themother-o’-pearl flocks which sometimes form and dissolve there
therewe worked revising mythology rounding a fable here and there andbuilding castles in the air for which earth offered no worthyfoundation
great looker
great expecter
to converse with whom was anew england night’s entertainment
ah
such discourse we had hermitand philosopher and the old settler i have spoken of—we three—itexpanded and racked my little house i should not dare to say how manypounds’ weight there was above the atmospheric pressure on everycircular inch it opened its seams so that they had to be calked withmuch dulness thereafter to stop the consequent leak—but i had enoughof that kind of oakum already picked
there was one other with whom i had “solid seasons” long to beremembered at his house in the village and who looked in upon me fromtime to time but i had no more for society there
there too as every where i sometimes expected the visitor who nevercomes
the vishnu purana says “the house-holder is to remain ateventide in his court-yard as long as it takes to milk a cow or longerif he pleases to await the arrival of a guest
” i often performed thisduty of hospitality waited long enough to milk a whole herd of cowsbut did not see the man approaching from the town
winter animalswhen the ponds were firmly frozen they afforded not only new andshorter routes to many points but new views from their surfaces of thefamiliar landscape around them
when i crossed flint’s pond after itwas covered with snow though i had often paddled about and skated overit it was so unexpectedly wide and so strange that i could think ofnothing but baffin’s bay
the lincoln hills rose up around me at theextremity of a snowy plain in which i did not remember to have stoodbefore and the fishermen at an indeterminable distance over the icemoving slowly about with their wolfish dogs passed for sealers oresquimaux or in misty weather loomed like fabulous creatures and idid not know whether they were giants or pygmies
i took this coursewhen i went to lecture in lincoln in the evening travelling in no roadand passing no house between my own hut and the lecture room
in goosepond which lay in my way a colony of muskrats dwelt and raised theircabins high above the ice though none could be seen abroad when icrossed it
walden being like the rest usually bare of snow or withonly shallow and interrupted drifts on it was my yard where i couldwalk freely when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level elsewhereand the villagers were confined to their streets
there far from thevillage street and except at very long intervals from the jingle ofsleigh-bells i slid and skated as in a vast moose-yard well troddenoverhung by oak woods and solemn pines bent down with snow or bristlingwith icicles
for sounds in winter nights and often in winter days i heard theforlorn but melodious note of a hooting owl indefinitely far such asound as the frozen earth would yield if struck with a suitableplectrum the very _lingua vernacula_ of walden wood and quitefamiliar to me at last though i never saw the bird while it was makingit
i seldom opened my door in a winter evening without hearing it_hoo hoo hoo hoorer hoo_ sounded sonorously and the first threesyllables accented somewhat like _how der do_ or sometimes _hoo hoo_only
one night in the beginning of winter before the pond froze overabout nine o’clock i was startled by the loud honking of a goose andstepping to the door heard the sound of their wings like a tempest inthe woods as they flew low over my house
they passed over the pondtoward fair haven seemingly deterred from settling by my light theircommodore honking all the while with a regular beat
suddenly anunmistakable cat-owl from very near me with the most harsh andtremendous voice i ever heard from any inhabitant of the woodsresponded at regular intervals to the goose as if determined to exposeand disgrace this intruder from hudson’s bay by exhibiting a greatercompass and volume of voice in a native and _boo-hoo_ him out ofconcord horizon
what do you mean by alarming the citadel at this timeof night consecrated to me
do you think i am ever caught napping atsuch an hour and that i have not got lungs and a larynx as well asyourself
_boo-hoo boo-hoo boo-hoo
_ it was one of the most thrillingdiscords i ever heard
and yet if you had a discriminating ear therewere in it the elements of a concord such as these plains never saw norheard
i also heard the whooping of the ice in the pond my great bed-fellowin that part of concord as if it were restless in its bed and wouldfain turn over were troubled with flatulency and had dreams or i waswaked by the cracking of the ground by the frost as if some one haddriven a team against my door and in the morning would find a crack inthe earth a quarter of a mile long and a third of an inch wide
sometimes i heard the foxes as they ranged over the snow crust inmoonlight nights in search of a partridge or other game barkingraggedly and demoniacally like forest dogs as if laboring with someanxiety or seeking expression struggling for light and to be dogsoutright and run freely in the streets for if we take the ages intoour account may there not be a civilization going on among brutes aswell as men
they seemed to me to be rudimental burrowing men stillstanding on their defence awaiting their transformation
sometimes onecame near to my window attracted by my light barked a vulpine curseat me and then retreated
usually the red squirrel (_sciurus hudsonius_) waked me in the dawncoursing over the roof and up and down the sides of the house as ifsent out of the woods for this purpose
in the course of the winter ithrew out half a bushel of ears of sweet-corn which had not got ripeon to the snow crust by my door and was amused by watching the motionsof the various animals which were baited by it
in the twilight and thenight the rabbits came regularly and made a hearty meal
all day longthe red squirrels came and went and afforded me much entertainment bytheir manœuvres
one would approach at first warily through theshrub-oaks running over the snow crust by fits and starts like a leafblown by the wind now a few paces this way with wonderful speed andwaste of energy making inconceivable haste with his “trotters” as ifit were for a wager and now as many paces that way but never gettingon more than half a rod at a time and then suddenly pausing with aludicrous expression and a gratuitous somerset as if all the eyes inthe universe were fixed on him—for all the motions of a squirrel evenin the most solitary recesses of the forest imply spectators as muchas those of a dancing girl—wasting more time in delay andcircumspection than would have sufficed to walk the whole distance—inever saw one walk—and then suddenly before you could say jackrobinson he would be in the top of a young pitch-pine winding up hisclock and chiding all imaginary spectators soliloquizing and talkingto all the universe at the same time—for no reason that i could everdetect or he himself was aware of i suspect
at length he would reachthe corn and selecting a suitable ear frisk about in the sameuncertain trigonometrical way to the top-most stick of my wood-pilebefore my window where he looked me in the face and there sit forhours supplying himself with a new ear from time to time nibbling atfirst voraciously and throwing the half-naked cobs about till atlength he grew more dainty still and played with his food tasting onlythe inside of the kernel and the ear which was held balanced over thestick by one paw slipped from his careless grasp and fell to theground when he would look over at it with a ludicrous expression ofuncertainty as if suspecting that it had life with a mind not made upwhether to get it again or a new one or be off now thinking of cornthen listening to hear what was in the wind
so the little impudentfellow would waste many an ear in a forenoon till at last seizingsome longer and plumper one considerably bigger than himself andskilfully balancing it he would set out with it to the woods like atiger with a buffalo by the same zig-zag course and frequent pausesscratching along with it as if it were too heavy for him and fallingall the while making its fall a diagonal between a perpendicular andhorizontal being determined to put it through at any rate—asingularly frivolous and whimsical fellow—and so he would get off withit to where he lived perhaps carry it to the top of a pine tree fortyor fifty rods distant and i would afterwards find the cobs strewnabout the woods in various directions
at length the jays arrive whose discordant screams were heard longbefore as they were warily making their approach an eighth of a mileoff and in a stealthy and sneaking manner they flit from tree to treenearer and nearer and pick up the kernels which the squirrels havedropped
then sitting on a pitch-pine bough they attempt to swallowin their haste a kernel which is too big for their throats and chokesthem and after great labor they disgorge it and spend an hour in theendeavor to crack it by repeated blows with their bills
they weremanifestly thieves and i had not much respect for them but thesquirrels though at first shy went to work as if they were takingwhat was their own
meanwhile also came the chickadees in flocks which picking up thecrumbs the squirrels had dropped flew to the nearest twig andplacing them under their claws hammered away at them with their littlebills as if it were an insect in the bark till they were sufficientlyreduced for their slender throats
a little flock of these tit-micecame daily to pick a dinner out of my wood-pile or the crumbs at mydoor with faint flitting lisping notes like the tinkling of iciclesin the grass or else with sprightly _day day day_ or more rarely inspring-like days a wiry summery _phe-be_ from the wood-side
they wereso familiar that at length one alighted on an armful of wood which iwas carrying in and pecked at the sticks without fear
i once had asparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment while i was hoeing in avillage garden and i felt that i was more distinguished by thatcircumstance than i should have been by any epaulet i could have worn
the squirrels also grew at last to be quite familiar and occasionallystepped upon my shoe when that was the nearest way
when the ground was not yet quite covered and again near the end ofwinter when the snow was melted on my south hill-side and about mywood-pile the partridges came out of the woods morning and evening tofeed there
whichever side you walk in the woods the partridge burstsaway on whirring wings jarring the snow from the dry leaves and twigson high which comes sifting down in the sun-beams like golden dustfor this brave bird is not to be scared by winter
it is frequentlycovered up by drifts and it is said “sometimes plunges from on winginto the soft snow where it remains concealed for a day or two
” iused to start them in the open land also where they had come out ofthe woods at sunset to “bud” the wild apple-trees
they will comeregularly every evening to particular trees where the cunningsportsman lies in wait for them and the distant orchards next thewoods suffer thus not a little
i am glad that the partridge gets fedat any rate
it is nature’s own bird which lives on buds anddiet-drink
in dark winter mornings or in short winter afternoons i sometimesheard a pack of hounds threading all the woods with hounding cry andyelp unable to resist the instinct of the chase and the note of thehunting horn at intervals proving that man was in the rear
the woodsring again and yet no fox bursts forth on to the open level of thepond nor following pack pursuing their actæon
and perhaps at eveningi see the hunters returning with a single brush trailing from theirsleigh for a trophy seeking their inn
they tell me that if the foxwould remain in the bosom of the frozen earth he would be safe or ifhe would run in a straight line away no fox-hound could overtake himbut having left his pursuers far behind he stops to rest and listentill they come up and when he runs he circles round to his old hauntswhere the hunters await him
sometimes however he will run upon awall many rods and then leap off far to one side and he appears toknow that water will not retain his scent
a hunter told me that heonce saw a fox pursued by hounds burst out on to walden when the icewas covered with shallow puddles run part way across and then returnto the same shore
ere long the hounds arrived but here they lost thescent
sometimes a pack hunting by themselves would pass my door andcircle round my house and yelp and hound without regarding me as ifafflicted by a species of madness so that nothing could divert themfrom the pursuit
thus they circle until they fall upon the recenttrail of a fox for a wise hound will forsake every thing else forthis
one day a man came to my hut from lexington to inquire after hishound that made a large track and had been hunting for a week byhimself
but i fear that he was not the wiser for all i told him forevery time i attempted to answer his questions he interrupted me byasking “what do you do here
” he had lost a dog but found a man
one old hunter who has a dry tongue who used to come to bathe inwalden once every year when the water was warmest and at such timeslooked in upon me told me that many years ago he took his gun oneafternoon and went out for a cruise in walden wood and as he walkedthe wayland road he heard the cry of hounds approaching and ere long afox leaped the wall into the road and as quick as thought leaped theother wall out of the road and his swift bullet had not touched him
some way behind came an old hound and her three pups in full pursuithunting on their own account and disappeared again in the woods
latein the afternoon as he was resting in the thick woods south of waldenhe heard the voice of the hounds far over toward fair haven stillpursuing the fox and on they came their hounding cry which made allthe woods ring sounding nearer and nearer now from well-meadow nowfrom the baker farm
for a long time he stood still and listened totheir music so sweet to a hunter’s ear when suddenly the foxappeared threading the solemn aisles with an easy coursing pace whosesound was concealed by a sympathetic rustle of the leaves swift andstill keeping the ground leaving his pursuers far behind andleaping upon a rock amid the woods he sat erect and listening withhis back to the hunter
for a moment compassion restrained the latter’sarm but that was a short-lived mood and as quick as thought canfollow thought his piece was levelled and _whang
_—the fox rollingover the rock lay dead on the ground
the hunter still kept his placeand listened to the hounds
still on they came and now the near woodsresounded through all their aisles with their demoniac cry
at lengththe old hound burst into view with muzzle to the ground and snappingthe air as if possessed and ran directly to the rock but spying thedead fox she suddenly ceased her hounding as if struck dumb withamazement and walked round and round him in silence and one by oneher pups arrived and like their mother were sobered into silence bythe mystery
then the hunter came forward and stood in their midst andthe mystery was solved
they waited in silence while he skinned thefox then followed the brush a while and at length turned off into thewoods again
that evening a weston squire came to the concord hunter’scottage to inquire for his hounds and told how for a week they hadbeen hunting on their own account from weston woods
the concord huntertold him what he knew and offered him the skin but the other declinedit and departed
he did not find his hounds that night but the nextday learned that they had crossed the river and put up at a farm-housefor the night whence having been well fed they took their departureearly in the morning
the hunter who told me this could remember one sam nutting who used tohunt bears on fair haven ledges and exchange their skins for rum inconcord village who told him even that he had seen a moose there
nutting had a famous fox-hound named burgoyne—he pronounced itbugine—which my informant used to borrow
in the “wast book” of an oldtrader of this town who was also a captain town-clerk andrepresentative i find the following entry
jan
18th 1742–3 “johnmelven cr
by 1 grey fox 0—2—3” they are not now found here and inhis ledger feb
7th 1743 hezekiah stratton has credit “by ½ a cattskin 0—1—4½” of course a wild-cat for stratton was a sergeant in theold french war and would not have got credit for hunting less noblegame
credit is given for deer skins also and they were daily sold
one man still preserves the horns of the last deer that was killed inthis vicinity and another has told me the particulars of the hunt inwhich his uncle was engaged
the hunters were formerly a numerous andmerry crew here
i remember well one gaunt nimrod who would catch up aleaf by the road-side and play a strain on it wilder and moremelodious if my memory serves me than any hunting-horn
at midnight when there was a moon i sometimes met with hounds in mypath prowling about the woods which would skulk out of my way as ifafraid and stand silent amid the bushes till i had passed
squirrels and wild mice disputed for my store of nuts
there werescores of pitch-pines around my house from one to four inches indiameter which had been gnawed by mice the previous winter—anorwegian winter for them for the snow lay long and deep and theywere obliged to mix a large proportion of pine bark with their otherdiet
these trees were alive and apparently flourishing at mid-summerand many of them had grown a foot though completely girdled but afteranother winter such were without exception dead
it is remarkable thata single mouse should thus be allowed a whole pine tree for its dinnergnawing round instead of up and down it but perhaps it is necessary inorder to thin these trees which are wont to grow up densely
the hares (_lepus americanus_) were very familiar
one had her formunder my house all winter separated from me only by the flooring andshe startled me each morning by her hasty departure when i began tostir—thump thump thump striking her head against the floor timbersin her hurry
they used to come round my door at dusk to nibble thepotato parings which i had thrown out and were so nearly the color ofthe ground that they could hardly be distinguished when still
sometimes in the twilight i alternately lost and recovered sight of onesitting motionless under my window
when i opened my door in theevening off they would go with a squeak and a bounce
near at handthey only excited my pity
one evening one sat by my door two pacesfrom me at first trembling with fear yet unwilling to move a poorwee thing lean and bony with ragged ears and sharp nose scant tailand slender paws
it looked as if nature no longer contained the breedof nobler bloods but stood on her last toes
its large eyes appearedyoung and unhealthy almost dropsical
i took a step and lo away itscud with an elastic spring over the snow crust straightening its bodyand its limbs into graceful length and soon put the forest between meand itself—the wild free venison asserting its vigor and the dignityof nature
not without reason was its slenderness
such then was itsnature
(_lepus_ _levipes_ light-foot some think
)what is a country without rabbits and partridges
they are among themost simple and indigenous animal products ancient and venerablefamilies known to antiquity as to modern times of the very hue andsubstance of nature nearest allied to leaves and to the ground—and toone another it is either winged or it is legged
it is hardly as ifyou had seen a wild creature when a rabbit or a partridge bursts awayonly a natural one as much to be expected as rustling leaves
thepartridge and the rabbit are still sure to thrive like true natives ofthe soil whatever revolutions occur
if the forest is cut off thesprouts and bushes which spring up afford them concealment and theybecome more numerous than ever
that must be a poor country indeed thatdoes not support a hare
our woods teem with them both and aroundevery swamp may be seen the partridge or rabbit walk beset with twiggyfences and horse-hair snares which some cow-boy tends
the pond in winterafter a still winter night i awoke with the impression that somequestion had been put to me which i had been endeavoring in vain toanswer in my sleep as what—how—when—where
but there was dawningnature in whom all creatures live looking in at my broad windows withserene and satisfied face and no question on _her_ lips
i awoke to ananswered question to nature and daylight
the snow lying deep on theearth dotted with young pines and the very slope of the hill on whichmy house is placed seemed to say forward
nature puts no question andanswers none which we mortals ask
she has long ago taken herresolution
“o prince our eyes contemplate with admiration andtransmit to the soul the wonderful and varied spectacle of thisuniverse
the night veils without doubt a part of this gloriouscreation but day comes to reveal to us this great work which extendsfrom earth even into the plains of the ether
”then to my morning work
first i take an axe and pail and go in searchof water if that be not a dream
after a cold and snowy night itneeded a divining rod to find it
every winter the liquid and tremblingsurface of the pond which was so sensitive to every breath andreflected every light and shadow becomes solid to the depth of a footor a foot and a half so that it will support the heaviest teams andperchance the snow covers it to an equal depth and it is not to bedistinguished from any level field
like the marmots in the surroundinghills it closes its eye-lids and becomes dormant for three months ormore
standing on the snow-covered plain as if in a pasture amid thehills i cut my way first through a foot of snow and then a foot ofice and open a window under my feet where kneeling to drink i lookdown into the quiet parlor of the fishes pervaded by a softened lightas through a window of ground glass with its bright sanded floor thesame as in summer there a perennial waveless serenity reigns as in theamber twilight sky corresponding to the cool and even temperament ofthe inhabitants
heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads
early in the morning while all things are crisp with frost men comewith fishing reels and slender lunch and let down their fine linesthrough the snowy field to take pickerel and perch wild men whoinstinctively follow other fashions and trust other authorities thantheir townsmen and by their goings and comings stitch towns togetherin parts where else they would be ripped
they sit and eat theirluncheon in stout fear-naughts on the dry oak leaves on the shore aswise in natural lore as the citizen is in artificial
they neverconsulted with books and know and can tell much less than they havedone
the things which they practise are said not yet to be known
hereis one fishing for pickerel with grown perch for bait
you look intohis pail with wonder as into a summer pond as if he kept summer lockedup at home or knew where she had retreated
how pray did he getthese in mid-winter
o he got worms out of rotten logs since theground froze and so he caught them
his life itself passes deeper innature than the studies of the naturalist penetrate himself a subjectfor the naturalist
the latter raises the moss and bark gently with hisknife in search of insects the former lays open logs to their corewith his axe and moss and bark fly far and wide
he gets his living bybarking trees
such a man has some right to fish and i love to seenature carried out in him
the perch swallows the grub-worm thepickerel swallows the perch and the fisher-man swallows the pickereland so all the chinks in the scale of being are filled
when i strolled around the pond in misty weather i was sometimes amusedby the primitive mode which some ruder fisherman had adopted
he wouldperhaps have placed alder branches over the narrow holes in the icewhich were four or five rods apart and an equal distance from theshore and having fastened the end of the line to a stick to preventits being pulled through have passed the slack line over a twig of thealder a foot or more above the ice and tied a dry oak leaf to itwhich being pulled down would show when he had a bite
these aldersloomed through the mist at regular intervals as you walked half wayround the pond
ah the pickerel of walden
when i see them lying on the ice or in thewell which the fisherman cuts in the ice making a little hole to admitthe water i am always surprised by their rare beauty as if they werefabulous fishes they are so foreign to the streets even to the woodsforeign as arabia to our concord life
they possess a quite dazzlingand transcendent beauty which separates them by a wide interval fromthe cadaverous cod and haddock whose fame is trumpeted in our streets
they are not green like the pines nor gray like the stones nor bluelike the sky but they have to my eyes if possible yet rarer colorslike flowers and precious stones as if they were the pearls theanimalized _nuclei_ or crystals of the walden water
they of courseare walden all over and all through are themselves small waldens inthe animal kingdom waldenses
it is surprising that they are caughthere—that in this deep and capacious spring far beneath the rattlingteams and chaises and tinkling sleighs that travel the walden roadthis great gold and emerald fish swims
i never chanced to see its kindin any market it would be the cynosure of all eyes there
easily witha few convulsive quirks they give up their watery ghosts like amortal translated before his time to the thin air of heaven
walden_pond_mapas i was desirous to recover the long lost bottom of walden pond isurveyed it carefully before the ice broke up early in ’46 withcompass and chain and sounding line
there have been many stories toldabout the bottom or rather no bottom of this pond which certainlyhad no foundation for themselves
it is remarkable how long men willbelieve in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble tosound it
i have visited two such bottomless ponds in one walk in thisneighborhood
many have believed that walden reached quite through tothe other side of the globe
some who have lain flat on the ice for along time looking down through the illusive medium perchance withwatery eyes into the bargain and driven to hasty conclusions by thefear of catching cold in their breasts have seen vast holes “intowhich a load of hay might be driven” if there were any body to driveit the undoubted source of the styx and entrance to the infernalregions from these parts
others have gone down from the village with a“fifty-six” and a wagon load of inch rope but yet have failed to findany bottom for while the “fifty-six” was resting by the way they werepaying out the rope in the vain attempt to fathom their trulyimmeasurable capacity for marvellousness
but i can assure my readersthat walden has a reasonably tight bottom at a not unreasonable thoughat an unusual depth
i fathomed it easily with a cod-line and a stoneweighing about a pound and a half and could tell accurately when thestone left the bottom by having to pull so much harder before thewater got underneath to help me
the greatest depth was exactly onehundred and two feet to which may be added the five feet which it hasrisen since making one hundred and seven
this is a remarkable depthfor so small an area yet not an inch of it can be spared by theimagination
what if all ponds were shallow
would it not react on theminds of men
i am thankful that this pond was made deep and pure for asymbol
while men believe in the infinite some ponds will be thought tobe bottomless
a factory owner hearing what depth i had found thought that it couldnot be true for judging from his acquaintance with dams sand wouldnot lie at so steep an angle
but the deepest ponds are not so deep inproportion to their area as most suppose and if drained would notleave very remarkable valleys
they are not like cups between thehills for this one which is so unusually deep for its area appearsin a vertical section through its centre not deeper than a shallowplate
most ponds emptied would leave a meadow no more hollow than wefrequently see
william gilpin who is so admirable in all that relatesto landscapes and usually so correct standing at the head of lochfyne in scotland which he describes as “a bay of salt water sixty orseventy fathoms deep four miles in breadth” and about fifty mileslong surrounded by mountains observes “if we could have seen itimmediately after the diluvian crash or whatever convulsion of natureoccasioned it before the waters gushed in what a horrid chasm must ithave appeared
so high as heaved the tumid hills so low     down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep     capacious bed of waters—
”but if using the shortest diameter of loch fyne we apply theseproportions to walden which as we have seen appears already in avertical section only like a shallow plate it will appear four timesas shallow
so much for the _increased_ horrors of the chasm of lochfyne when emptied
no doubt many a smiling valley with its stretchingcornfields occupies exactly such a “horrid chasm” from which thewaters have receded though it requires the insight and the far sightof the geologist to convince the unsuspecting inhabitants of this fact
often an inquisitive eye may detect the shores of a primitive lake inthe low horizon hills and no subsequent elevation of the plain hasbeen necessary to conceal their history
but it is easiest as they whowork on the highways know to find the hollows by the puddles after ashower
the amount of it is the imagination give it the least licensedives deeper and soars higher than nature goes
so probably the depthof the ocean will be found to be very inconsiderable compared with itsbreadth
as i sounded through the ice i could determine the shape of the bottomwith greater accuracy than is possible in surveying harbors which donot freeze over and i was surprised at its general regularity
in thedeepest part there are several acres more level than almost any fieldwhich is exposed to the sun wind and plough
in one instance on a linearbitrarily chosen the depth did not vary more than one foot in thirtyrods and generally near the middle i could calculate the variationfor each one hundred feet in any direction beforehand within three orfour inches
some are accustomed to speak of deep and dangerous holeseven in quiet sandy ponds like this but the effect of water underthese circumstances is to level all inequalities
the regularity of thebottom and its conformity to the shores and the range of theneighboring hills were so perfect that a distant promontory betrayeditself in the soundings quite across the pond and its direction couldbe determined by observing the opposite shore
cape becomes bar andplain shoal and valley and gorge deep water and channel
when i had mapped the pond by the scale of ten rods to an inch and putdown the soundings more than a hundred in all i observed thisremarkable coincidence
having noticed that the number indicating thegreatest depth was apparently in the centre of the map i laid a ruleon the map lengthwise and then breadthwise and found to my surprisethat the line of greatest length intersected the line of greatestbreadth _exactly_ at the point of greatest depth notwithstanding thatthe middle is so nearly level the outline of the pond far fromregular and the extreme length and breadth were got by measuring intothe coves and i said to myself who knows but this hint would conductto the deepest part of the ocean as well as of a pond or puddle
is notthis the rule also for the height of mountains regarded as theopposite of valleys
we know that a hill is not highest at itsnarrowest part
of five coves three or all which had been sounded were observed tohave a bar quite across their mouths and deeper water within so thatthe bay tended to be an expansion of water within the land not onlyhorizontally but vertically and to form a basin or independent pondthe direction of the two capes showing the course of the bar
everyharbor on the sea-coast also has its bar at its entrance
inproportion as the mouth of the cove was wider compared with its lengththe water over the bar was deeper compared with that in the basin
given then the length and breadth of the cove and the character ofthe surrounding shore and you have almost elements enough to make outa formula for all cases
in order to see how nearly i could guess with this experience at thedeepest point in a pond by observing the outlines of its surface andthe character of its shores alone i made a plan of white pond whichcontains about forty-one acres and like this has no island in itnor any visible inlet or outlet and as the line of greatest breadthfell very near the line of least breadth where two opposite capesapproached each other and two opposite bays receded i ventured to marka point a short distance from the latter line but still on the line ofgreatest length as the deepest
the deepest part was found to bewithin one hundred feet of this still farther in the direction towhich i had inclined and was only one foot deeper namely sixty feet
of course a stream running through or an island in the pond wouldmake the problem much more complicated
if we knew all the laws of nature we should need only one fact or thedescription of one actual phenomenon to infer all the particularresults at that point
now we know only a few laws and our result isvitiated not of course by any confusion or irregularity in naturebut by our ignorance of essential elements in the calculation
ournotions of law and harmony are commonly confined to those instanceswhich we detect but the harmony which results from a far greaternumber of seemingly conflicting but really concurring laws which wehave not detected is still more wonderful
the particular laws are asour points of view as to the traveller a mountain outline varieswith every step and it has an infinite number of profiles thoughabsolutely but one form
even when cleft or bored through it is notcomprehended in its entireness
what i have observed of the pond is no less true in ethics
it is thelaw of average
such a rule of the two diameters not only guides ustoward the sun in the system and the heart in man but draw linesthrough the length and breadth of the aggregate of a man’s particulardaily behaviors and waves of life into his coves and inlets and wherethey intersect will be the height or depth of his character
perhaps weneed only to know how his shores trend and his adjacent country orcircumstances to infer his depth and concealed bottom
if he issurrounded by mountainous circumstances an achillean shore whosepeaks overshadow and are reflected in his bosom they suggest acorresponding depth in him
but a low and smooth shore proves himshallow on that side
in our bodies a bold projecting brow falls offto and indicates a corresponding depth of thought
also there is a baracross the entrance of our every cove or particular inclination eachis our harbor for a season in which we are detained and partiallyland-locked
these inclinations are not whimsical usually but theirform size and direction are determined by the promontories of theshore the ancient axes of elevation
when this bar is graduallyincreased by storms tides or currents or there is a subsidence ofthe waters so that it reaches to the surface that which was at firstbut an inclination in the shore in which a thought was harbored becomesan individual lake cut off from the ocean wherein the thought securesits own conditions changes perhaps from salt to fresh becomes asweet sea dead sea or a marsh
at the advent of each individual intothis life may we not suppose that such a bar has risen to the surfacesomewhere
it is true we are such poor navigators that our thoughtsfor the most part stand off and on upon a harborless coast areconversant only with the bights of the bays of poesy or steer for thepublic ports of entry and go into the dry docks of science where theymerely refit for this world and no natural currents concur toindividualize them
as for the inlet or outlet of walden i have not discovered any butrain and snow and evaporation though perhaps with a thermometer and aline such places may be found for where the water flows into the pondit will probably be coldest in summer and warmest in winter
when theice-men were at work here in ’46–7 the cakes sent to the shore wereone day rejected by those who were stacking them up there not beingthick enough to lie side by side with the rest and the cutters thusdiscovered that the ice over a small space was two or three inchesthinner than elsewhere which made them think that there was an inletthere
they also showed me in another place what they thought was a“leach hole” through which the pond leaked out under a hill into aneighboring meadow pushing me out on a cake of ice to see it
it was asmall cavity under ten feet of water but i think that i can warrantthe pond not to need soldering till they find a worse leak than that
one has suggested that if such a “leach hole” should be found itsconnection with the meadow if any existed might be proved byconveying some colored powder or sawdust to the mouth of the hole andthen putting a strainer over the spring in the meadow which wouldcatch some of the particles carried through by the current
while i was surveying the ice which was sixteen inches thickundulated under a slight wind like water
it is well known that a levelcannot be used on ice
at one rod from the shore its greatestfluctuation when observed by means of a level on land directed towarda graduated staff on the ice was three quarters of an inch though theice appeared firmly attached to the shore
it was probably greater inthe middle
who knows but if our instruments were delicate enough wemight detect an undulation in the crust of the earth
when two legs ofmy level were on the shore and the third on the ice and the sightswere directed over the latter a rise or fall of the ice of an almostinfinitesimal amount made a difference of several feet on a tree acrossthe pond
when i began to cut holes for sounding there were three orfour inches of water on the ice under a deep snow which had sunk itthus far but the water began immediately to run into these holes andcontinued to run for two days in deep streams which wore away the iceon every side and contributed essentially if not mainly to dry thesurface of the pond for as the water ran in it raised and floatedthe ice
this was somewhat like cutting a hole in the bottom of a shipto let the water out
when such holes freeze and a rain succeeds andfinally a new freezing forms a fresh smooth ice over all it isbeautifully mottled internally by dark figures shaped somewhat like aspider’s web what you may call ice rosettes produced by the channelsworn by the water flowing from all sides to a centre
sometimes alsowhen the ice was covered with shallow puddles i saw a double shadow ofmyself one standing on the head of the other one on the ice theother on the trees or hill-side
while yet it is cold january and snow and ice are thick and solid theprudent landlord comes from the village to get ice to cool his summerdrink impressively even pathetically wise to foresee the heat andthirst of july now in january—wearing a thick coat and mittens
whenso many things are not provided for
it may be that he lays up notreasures in this world which will cool his summer drink in the next
he cuts and saws the solid pond unroofs the house of fishes and cartsoff their very element and air held fast by chains and stakes likecorded wood through the favoring winter air to wintry cellars tounderlie the summer there
it looks like solidified azure as far offit is drawn through the streets
these ice-cutters are a merry racefull of jest and sport and when i went among them they were wont toinvite me to saw pit-fashion with them i standing underneath
in the winter of ’46–7 there came a hundred men of hyperboreanextraction swoop down on to our pond one morning with many car-loadsof ungainly-looking farming tools sleds ploughs drill-barrowsturf-knives spades saws rakes and each man was armed with adouble-pointed pike-staff such as is not described in the new-englandfarmer or the cultivator
i did not know whether they had come to sow acrop of winter rye or some other kind of grain recently introducedfrom iceland
as i saw no manure i judged that they meant to skim theland as i had done thinking the soil was deep and had lain fallowlong enough
they said that a gentleman farmer who was behind thescenes wanted to double his money which as i understood amounted tohalf a million already but in order to cover each one of his dollarswith another he took off the only coat ay the skin itself of waldenpond in the midst of a hard winter
they went to work at onceploughing harrowing rolling furrowing in admirable order as ifthey were bent on making this a model farm but when i was lookingsharp to see what kind of seed they dropped into the furrow a gang offellows by my side suddenly began to hook up the virgin mould itselfwith a peculiar jerk clean down to the sand or rather the water—forit was a very springy soil—indeed all the _terra firma_ there was—andhaul it away on sleds and then i guessed that they must be cuttingpeat in a bog
so they came and went every day with a peculiar shriekfrom the locomotive from and to some point of the polar regions as itseemed to me like a flock of arctic snow-birds
but sometimes squawwalden had her revenge and a hired man walking behind his teamslipped through a crack in the ground down toward tartarus and he whowas so brave before suddenly became but the ninth part of a man almostgave up his animal heat and was glad to take refuge in my house andacknowledged that there was some virtue in a stove or sometimes thefrozen soil took a piece of steel out of a ploughshare or a plough gotset in the furrow and had to be cut out
to speak literally a hundred irishmen with yankee overseers camefrom cambridge every day to get out the ice
they divided it into cakesby methods too well known to require description and these beingsledded to the shore were rapidly hauled off on to an ice platformand raised by grappling irons and block and tackle worked by horseson to a stack as surely as so many barrels of flour and there placedevenly side by side and row upon row as if they formed the solid baseof an obelisk designed to pierce the clouds
they told me that in agood day they could get out a thousand tons which was the yield ofabout one acre
deep ruts and “cradle holes” were worn in the ice ason _terra firma_ by the passage of the sleds over the same track andthe horses invariably ate their oats out of cakes of ice hollowed outlike buckets
they stacked up the cakes thus in the open air in a pilethirty-five feet high on one side and six or seven rods square puttinghay between the outside layers to exclude the air for when the windthough never so cold finds a passage through it will wear largecavities leaving slight supports or studs only here and there andfinally topple it down
at first it looked like a vast blue fort orvalhalla but when they began to tuck the coarse meadow hay into thecrevices and this became covered with rime and icicles it looked likea venerable moss-grown and hoary ruin built of azure-tinted marblethe abode of winter that old man we see in the almanac—his shanty asif he had a design to estivate with us
they calculated that nottwenty-five per cent of this would reach its destination and that twoor three per cent would be wasted in the cars
however a still greaterpart of this heap had a different destiny from what was intended foreither because the ice was found not to keep so well as was expectedcontaining more air than usual or for some other reason it never gotto market
this heap made in the winter of ’46–7 and estimated tocontain ten thousand tons was finally covered with hay and boards andthough it was unroofed the following july and a part of it carriedoff the rest remaining exposed to the sun it stood over that summerand the next winter and was not quite melted till september 1848
thusthe pond recovered the greater part
like the water the walden ice seen near at hand has a green tintbut at a distance is beautifully blue and you can easily tell it fromthe white ice of the river or the merely greenish ice of some ponds aquarter of a mile off
sometimes one of those great cakes slips fromthe ice-man’s sled into the village street and lies there for a weeklike a great emerald an object of interest to all passers
i havenoticed that a portion of walden which in the state of water was greenwill often when frozen appear from the same point of view blue
sothe hollows about this pond will sometimes in the winter be filledwith a greenish water somewhat like its own but the next day will havefrozen blue
perhaps the blue color of water and ice is due to thelight and air they contain and the most transparent is the bluest
iceis an interesting subject for contemplation
they told me that they hadsome in the ice-houses at fresh pond five years old which was as goodas ever
why is it that a bucket of water soon becomes putrid butfrozen remains sweet forever
it is commonly said that this is thedifference between the affections and the intellect
thus for sixteen days i saw from my window a hundred men at work likebusy husbandmen with teams and horses and apparently all theimplements of farming such a picture as we see on the first page ofthe almanac and as often as i looked out i was reminded of the fableof the lark and the reapers or the parable of the sower and the likeand now they are all gone and in thirty days more probably i shalllook from the same window on the pure sea-green walden water therereflecting the clouds and the trees and sending up its evaporations insolitude and no traces will appear that a man has ever stood there
perhaps i shall hear a solitary loon laugh as he dives and plumeshimself or shall see a lonely fisher in his boat like a floatingleaf beholding his form reflected in the waves where lately a hundredmen securely labored
thus it appears that the sweltering inhabitants of charleston and neworleans of madras and bombay and calcutta drink at my well
in themorning i bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonalphilosophy of the bhagvat geeta since whose composition years of thegods have elapsed and in comparison with which our modern world andits literature seem puny and trivial and i doubt if that philosophy isnot to be referred to a previous state of existence so remote is itssublimity from our conceptions
i lay down the book and go to my wellfor water and lo
there i meet the servant of the bramin priest ofbrahma and vishnu and indra who still sits in his temple on the gangesreading the vedas or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust andwater jug
i meet his servant come to draw water for his master andour buckets as it were grate together in the same well
the pure waldenwater is mingled with the sacred water of the ganges
with favoringwinds it is wafted past the site of the fabulous islands of atlantisand the hesperides makes the periplus of hanno and floating byternate and tidore and the mouth of the persian gulf melts in thetropic gales of the indian seas and is landed in ports of whichalexander only heard the names
springthe opening of large tracts by the ice-cutters commonly causes a pondto break up earlier for the water agitated by the wind even in coldweather wears away the surrounding ice
but such was not the effect onwalden that year for she had soon got a thick new garment to take theplace of the old
this pond never breaks up so soon as the others inthis neighborhood on account both of its greater depth and its havingno stream passing through it to melt or wear away the ice
i never knewit to open in the course of a winter not excepting that of ’52–3which gave the ponds so severe a trial
it commonly opens about thefirst of april a week or ten days later than flint’s pond andfair-haven beginning to melt on the north side and in the shallowerparts where it began to freeze
it indicates better than any waterhereabouts the absolute progress of the season being least affected bytransient changes of temperature
a severe cold of a few days’ durationin march may very much retard the opening of the former ponds whilethe temperature of walden increases almost uninterruptedly
athermometer thrust into the middle of walden on the 6th of march 1847stood at 32° or freezing point near the shore at 33° in the middleof flint’s pond the same day at 32½° at a dozen rods from the shorein shallow water under ice a foot thick at 36°
this difference ofthree and a half degrees between the temperature of the deep water andthe shallow in the latter pond and the fact that a great proportion ofit is comparatively shallow show why it should break up so much soonerthan walden
the ice in the shallowest part was at this time severalinches thinner than in the middle
in mid-winter the middle had beenthe warmest and the ice thinnest there
so also every one who haswaded about the shores of the pond in summer must have perceived howmuch warmer the water is close to the shore where only three or fourinches deep than a little distance out and on the surface where it isdeep than near the bottom
in spring the sun not only exerts aninfluence through the increased temperature of the air and earth butits heat passes through ice a foot or more thick and is reflected fromthe bottom in shallow water and so also warms the water and melts theunder side of the ice at the same time that it is melting it moredirectly above making it uneven and causing the air bubbles which itcontains to extend themselves upward and downward until it iscompletely honeycombed and at last disappears suddenly in a singlespring rain
ice has its grain as well as wood and when a cake beginsto rot or “comb” that is assume the appearance of honey-combwhatever may be its position the air cells are at right angles withwhat was the water surface
where there is a rock or a log rising nearto the surface the ice over it is much thinner and is frequently quitedissolved by this reflected heat and i have been told that in theexperiment at cambridge to freeze water in a shallow wooden pondthough the cold air circulated underneath and so had access to bothsides the reflection of the sun from the bottom more thancounterbalanced this advantage
when a warm rain in the middle of thewinter melts off the snow-ice from walden and leaves a hard dark ortransparent ice on the middle there will be a strip of rotten thoughthicker white ice a rod or more wide about the shores created bythis reflected heat
also as i have said the bubbles themselveswithin the ice operate as burning-glasses to melt the ice beneath
the phenomena of the year take place every day in a pond on a smallscale
every morning generally speaking the shallow water is beingwarmed more rapidly than the deep though it may not be made so warmafter all and every evening it is being cooled more rapidly until themorning
the day is an epitome of the year
the night is the winterthe morning and evening are the spring and fall and the noon is thesummer
the cracking and booming of the ice indicate a change oftemperature
one pleasant morning after a cold night february 24th1850 having gone to flint’s pond to spend the day i noticed withsurprise that when i struck the ice with the head of my axe itresounded like a gong for many rods around or as if i had struck on atight drum-head
the pond began to boom about an hour after sunrisewhen it felt the influence of the sun’s rays slanted upon it from overthe hills it stretched itself and yawned like a waking man with agradually increasing tumult which was kept up three or four hours
ittook a short siesta at noon and boomed once more toward night as thesun was withdrawing his influence
in the right stage of the weather apond fires its evening gun with great regularity
but in the middle ofthe day being full of cracks and the air also being less elastic ithad completely lost its resonance and probably fishes and muskratscould not then have been stunned by a blow on it
the fishermen saythat the “thundering of the pond” scares the fishes and prevents theirbiting
the pond does not thunder every evening and i cannot tellsurely when to expect its thundering but though i may perceive nodifference in the weather it does
who would have suspected so largeand cold and thick-skinned a thing to be so sensitive
yet it has itslaw to which it thunders obedience when it should as surely as the budsexpand in the spring
the earth is all alive and covered with papillæ
the largest pond is as sensitive to atmospheric changes as the globuleof mercury in its tube
one attraction in coming to the woods to live was that i should haveleisure and opportunity to see the spring come in
the ice in the pondat length begins to be honey-combed and i can set my heel in it as iwalk
fogs and rains and warmer suns are gradually melting the snowthe days have grown sensibly longer and i see how i shall get throughthe winter without adding to my wood-pile for large fires are nolonger necessary
i am on the alert for the first signs of spring tohear the chance note of some arriving bird or the striped squirrel’schirp for his stores must be now nearly exhausted or see thewoodchuck venture out of his winter quarters
on the 13th of marchafter i had heard the bluebird song-sparrow and red-wing the ice wasstill nearly a foot thick
as the weather grew warmer it was notsensibly worn away by the water nor broken up and floated off as inrivers but though it was completely melted for half a rod in widthabout the shore the middle was merely honey-combed and saturated withwater so that you could put your foot through it when six inchesthick but by the next day evening perhaps after a warm rain followedby fog it would have wholly disappeared all gone off with the fogspirited away
one year i went across the middle only five days beforeit disappeared entirely
in 1845 walden was first completely open onthe 1st of april in ’46 the 25th of march in ’47 the 8th of aprilin ’51 the 28th of march in ’52 the 18th of april in ’53 the 23dof march in ’54 about the 7th of april
every incident connected with the breaking up of the rivers and pondsand the settling of the weather is particularly interesting to us wholive in a climate of so great extremes
when the warmer days come theywho dwell near the river hear the ice crack at night with a startlingwhoop as loud as artillery as if its icy fetters were rent from end toend and within a few days see it rapidly going out
so the alligatorcomes out of the mud with quakings of the earth
one old man who hasbeen a close observer of nature and seems as thoroughly wise in regardto all her operations as if she had been put upon the stocks when hewas a boy and he had helped to lay her keel—who has come to hisgrowth and can hardly acquire more of natural lore if he should liveto the age of methuselah—told me and i was surprised to hear himexpress wonder at any of nature’s operations for i thought that therewere no secrets between them that one spring day he took his gun andboat and thought that he would have a little sport with the ducks
there was ice still on the meadows but it was all gone out of theriver and he dropped down without obstruction from sudbury where helived to fair-haven pond which he found unexpectedly covered forthe most part with a firm field of ice
it was a warm day and he wassurprised to see so great a body of ice remaining
not seeing anyducks he hid his boat on the north or back side of an island in thepond and then concealed himself in the bushes on the south side toawait them
the ice was melted for three or four rods from the shoreand there was a smooth and warm sheet of water with a muddy bottomsuch as the ducks love within and he thought it likely that somewould be along pretty soon
after he had lain still there about an hourhe heard a low and seemingly very distant sound but singularly grandand impressive unlike any thing he had ever heard gradually swellingand increasing as if it would have a universal and memorable ending asullen rush and roar which seemed to him all at once like the sound ofa vast body of fowl coming in to settle there and seizing his gun hestarted up in haste and excited but he found to his surprise thatthe whole body of the ice had started while he lay there and driftedin to the shore and the sound he had heard was made by its edgegrating on the shore—at first gently nibbled and crumbled off but atlength heaving up and scattering its wrecks along the island to aconsiderable height before it came to a stand still
at length the sun’s rays have attained the right angle and warm windsblow up mist and rain and melt the snow banks and the sun dispersingthe mist smiles on a checkered landscape of russet and white smokingwith incense through which the traveller picks his way from islet toislet cheered by the music of a thousand tinkling rills and rivuletswhose veins are filled with the blood of winter which they are bearingoff
few phenomena gave me more delight than to observe the forms whichthawing sand and clay assume in flowing down the sides of a deep cut onthe railroad through which i passed on my way to the village aphenomenon not very common on so large a scale though the number offreshly exposed banks of the right material must have been greatlymultiplied since railroads were invented
the material was sand ofevery degree of fineness and of various rich colors commonly mixedwith a little clay
when the frost comes out in the spring and even ina thawing day in the winter the sand begins to flow down the slopeslike lava sometimes bursting out through the snow and overflowing itwhere no sand was to be seen before
innumerable little streams overlapand interlace one with another exhibiting a sort of hybrid productwhich obeys half way the law of currents and half way that ofvegetation
as it flows it takes the forms of sappy leaves or vinesmaking heaps of pulpy sprays a foot or more in depth and resemblingas you look down on them the laciniated lobed and imbricatedthalluses of some lichens or you are reminded of coral of leopard’spaws or birds’ feet of brains or lungs or bowels and excrements ofall kinds
it is a truly _grotesque_ vegetation whose forms and colorwe see imitated in bronze a sort of architectural foliage more ancientand typical than acanthus chiccory ivy vine or any vegetableleaves destined perhaps under some circumstances to become a puzzleto future geologists
the whole cut impressed me as if it were a cavewith its stalactites laid open to the light
the various shades of thesand are singularly rich and agreeable embracing the different ironcolors brown gray yellowish and reddish
when the flowing massreaches the drain at the foot of the bank it spreads out flatter into_strands_ the separate streams losing their semi-cylindrical form andgradually becoming more flat and broad running together as they aremore moist till they form an almost flat _sand_ still variously andbeautifully shaded but in which you can trace the original forms ofvegetation till at length in the water itself they are convertedinto _banks_ like those formed off the mouths of rivers and the formsof vegetation are lost in the ripple marks on the bottom
the whole bank which is from twenty to forty feet high is sometimesoverlaid with a mass of this kind of foliage or sandy rupture for aquarter of a mile on one or both sides the produce of one spring day
what makes this sand foliage remarkable is its springing into existencethus suddenly
when i see on the one side the inert bank—for the sunacts on one side first—and on the other this luxuriant foliage thecreation of an hour i am affected as if in a peculiar sense i stood inthe laboratory of the artist who made the world and me—had come towhere he was still at work sporting on this bank and with excess ofenergy strewing his fresh designs about
i feel as if i were nearer tothe vitals of the globe for this sandy overflow is something such afoliaceous mass as the vitals of the animal body
you find thus in thevery sands an anticipation of the vegetable leaf
no wonder that theearth expresses itself outwardly in leaves it so labors with the ideainwardly
the atoms have already learned this law and are pregnant byit
the overhanging leaf sees here its prototype

the radicals of _lobe_ are _lb_ the soft mass of the_b_ (single lobed or b double lobed) with the liquid _l_ behind itpressing it forward
in globe _glb_ the guttural _g_ adds to themeaning the capacity of the throat
the feathers and wings of birds arestill drier and thinner leaves
thus also you pass from the lumpishgrub in the earth to the airy and fluttering butterfly
the very globecontinually transcends and translates itself and becomes winged in itsorbit
even ice begins with delicate crystal leaves as if it hadflowed into moulds which the fronds of water plants have impressed onthe watery mirror
the whole tree itself is but one leaf and riversare still vaster leaves whose pulp is intervening earth and towns andcities are the ova of insects in their axils
when the sun withdraws the sand ceases to flow but in the morning thestreams will start once more and branch and branch again into a myriadof others
you here see perchance how blood vessels are formed
if youlook closely you observe that first there pushes forward from thethawing mass a stream of softened sand with a drop-like point like theball of the finger feeling its way slowly and blindly downward untilat last with more heat and moisture as the sun gets higher the mostfluid portion in its effort to obey the law to which the most inertalso yields separates from the latter and forms for itself ameandering channel or artery within that in which is seen a littlesilvery stream glancing like lightning from one stage of pulpy leavesor branches to another and ever and anon swallowed up in the sand
itis wonderful how rapidly yet perfectly the sand organizes itself as itflows using the best material its mass affords to form the sharp edgesof its channel
such are the sources of rivers
in the silicious matterwhich the water deposits is perhaps the bony system and in the stillfiner soil and organic matter the fleshy fibre or cellular tissue
whatis man but a mass of thawing clay
the ball of the human finger is buta drop congealed
the fingers and toes flow to their extent from thethawing mass of the body
who knows what the human body would expandand flow out to under a more genial heaven
is not the hand a spreading_palm_ leaf with its lobes and veins
the ear may be regardedfancifully as a lichen _umbilicaria_ on the side of the head withits lobe or drop
the lip—_labium_ from _labor_ (
)—laps or lapsesfrom the sides of the cavernous mouth
the nose is a manifest congealeddrop or stalactite
the chin is a still larger drop the confluentdripping of the face
the cheeks are a slide from the brows into thevalley of the face opposed and diffused by the cheek bones
eachrounded lobe of the vegetable leaf too is a thick and now loiteringdrop larger or smaller the lobes are the fingers of the leaf and asmany lobes as it has in so many directions it tends to flow and moreheat or other genial influences would have caused it to flow yetfarther
thus it seemed that this one hillside illustrated the principle of allthe operations of nature
the maker of this earth but patented a leaf
what champollion will decipher this hieroglyphic for us that we mayturn over a new leaf at last
this phenomenon is more exhilarating tome than the luxuriance and fertility of vineyards
true it is somewhatexcrementitious in its character and there is no end to the heaps ofliver lights and bowels as if the globe were turned wrong sideoutward but this suggests at least that nature has some bowels andthere again is mother of humanity
this is the frost coming out of theground this is spring
it precedes the green and flowery spring asmythology precedes regular poetry
i know of nothing more purgative ofwinter fumes and indigestions
it convinces me that earth is still inher swaddling clothes and stretches forth baby fingers on every side
fresh curls spring from the baldest brow
there is nothing inorganic
these foliaceous heaps lie along the bank like the slag of a furnaceshowing that nature is “in full blast” within
the earth is not a merefragment of dead history stratum upon stratum like the leaves of abook to be studied by geologists and antiquaries chiefly but livingpoetry like the leaves of a tree which precede flowers and fruit—nota fossil earth but a living earth compared with whose great centrallife all animal and vegetable life is merely parasitic
its throes willheave our exuviæ from their graves
you may melt your metals and castthem into the most beautiful moulds you can they will never excite melike the forms which this molten earth flows out into
and not only itbut the institutions upon it are plastic like clay in the hands of thepotter
ere long not only on these banks but on every hill and plain and inevery hollow the frost comes out of the ground like a dormantquadruped from its burrow and seeks the sea with music or migrates toother climes in clouds
thaw with his gentle persuasion is morepowerful than thor with his hammer
the one melts the other but breaksin pieces
when the ground was partially bare of snow and a few warm days haddried its surface somewhat it was pleasant to compare the first tendersigns of the infant year just peeping forth with the stately beauty ofthe withered vegetation which had withstood thewinter—life-everlasting golden-rods pinweeds and graceful wildgrasses more obvious and interesting frequently than in summer evenas if their beauty was not ripe till then even cotton-grasscat-tails mulleins johnswort hard-hack meadow-sweet and otherstrong stemmed plants those unexhausted granaries which entertain theearliest birds—decent weeds at least which widowed nature wears
iam particularly attracted by the arching and sheaf-like top of thewool-grass it brings back the summer to our winter memories and isamong the forms which art loves to copy and which in the vegetablekingdom have the same relation to types already in the mind of manthat astronomy has
it is an antique style older than greek oregyptian
many of the phenomena of winter are suggestive of aninexpressible tenderness and fragile delicacy
we are accustomed tohear this king described as a rude and boisterous tyrant but with thegentleness of a lover he adorns the tresses of summer
at the approach of spring the red-squirrels got under my house two ata time directly under my feet as i sat reading or writing and kept upthe queerest chuckling and chirruping and vocal pirouetting andgurgling sounds that ever were heard and when i stamped they onlychirruped the louder as if past all fear and respect in their madpranks defying humanity to stop them
no youdon’t—chickaree—chickaree
they were wholly deaf to my arguments orfailed to perceive their force and fell into a strain of invectivethat was irresistible
the first sparrow of spring
the year beginning with younger hope thanever
the faint silvery warblings heard over the partially bare andmoist fields from the blue-bird the song-sparrow and the red-wing asif the last flakes of winter tinkled as they fell
what at such a timeare histories chronologies traditions and all written revelations
the brooks sing carols and glees to the spring
the marsh-hawk sailinglow over the meadow is already seeking the first slimy life thatawakes
the sinking sound of melting snow is heard in all dells andthe ice dissolves apace in the ponds
the grass flames up on thehillsides like a spring fire—“et primitus oritur herba imbribusprimoribus evocata”—as if the earth sent forth an inward heat to greetthe returning sun not yellow but green is the color of its flame—thesymbol of perpetual youth the grass-blade like a long green ribbonstreams from the sod into the summer checked indeed by the frost butanon pushing on again lifting its spear of last year’s hay with thefresh life below
it grows as steadily as the rill oozes out of theground
it is almost identical with that for in the growing days ofjune when the rills are dry the grass blades are their channels andfrom year to year the herds drink at this perennial green stream andthe mower draws from it betimes their winter supply
so our human lifebut dies down to its root and still puts forth its green blade toeternity
walden is melting apace
there is a canal two rods wide along thenortherly and westerly sides and wider still at the east end
a greatfield of ice has cracked off from the main body
i hear a song-sparrowsinging from the bushes on the shore—_olit_ _olit_ _olit_—_chip__chip_ _chip_ _che char_—_che wiss_ _wiss_ _wiss_
he too ishelping to crack it
how handsome the great sweeping curves in the edgeof the ice answering somewhat to those of the shore but more regular
it is unusually hard owing to the recent severe but transient coldand all watered or waved like a palace floor
but the wind slideseastward over its opaque surface in vain till it reaches the livingsurface beyond
it is glorious to behold this ribbon of water sparklingin the sun the bare face of the pond full of glee and youth as if itspoke the joy of the fishes within it and of the sands on its shore—asilvery sheen as from the scales of a _leuciscus_ as it were all oneactive fish
such is the contrast between winter and spring
walden wasdead and is alive again
but this spring it broke up more steadily asi have said
the change from storm and winter to serene and mild weather from darkand sluggish hours to bright and elastic ones is a memorable crisiswhich all things proclaim
it is seemingly instantaneous at last
suddenly an influx of light filled my house though the evening was athand and the clouds of winter still overhung it and the eaves weredripping with sleety rain
i looked out the window and lo
whereyesterday was cold gray ice there lay the transparent pond already calmand full of hope as in a summer evening reflecting a summer eveningsky in its bosom though none was visible overhead as if it hadintelligence with some remote horizon
i heard a robin in the distancethe first i had heard for many a thousand years methought whose notei shall not forget for many a thousand more—the same sweet andpowerful song as of yore
o the evening robin at the end of a newengland summer day
if i could ever find the twig he sits upon
i mean_he_ i mean _the twig_
this at least is not the _turdus migratorius_
the pitch-pines and shrub-oaks about my house which had so longdrooped suddenly resumed their several characters looked brightergreener and more erect and alive as if effectually cleansed andrestored by the rain
i knew that it would not rain any more
you maytell by looking at any twig of the forest ay at your very wood-pilewhether its winter is past or not
as it grew darker i was startled bythe _honking_ of geese flying low over the woods like weary travellersgetting in late from southern lakes and indulging at last inunrestrained complaint and mutual consolation
standing at my door icould hear the rush of their wings when driving toward my house theysuddenly spied my light and with hushed clamor wheeled and settled inthe pond
so i came in and shut the door and passed my first springnight in the woods
in the morning i watched the geese from the door through the mistsailing in the middle of the pond fifty rods off so large andtumultuous that walden appeared like an artificial pond for theiramusement
but when i stood on the shore they at once rose up with agreat flapping of wings at the signal of their commander and when theyhad got into rank circled about over my head twenty-nine of them andthen steered straight to canada with a regular _honk_ from the leaderat intervals trusting to break their fast in muddier pools
a “plump”of ducks rose at the same time and took the route to the north in thewake of their noisier cousins
for a week i heard the circling groping clangor of some solitary goosein the foggy mornings seeking its companion and still peopling thewoods with the sound of a larger life than they could sustain
in aprilthe pigeons were seen again flying express in small flocks and in duetime i heard the martins twittering over my clearing though it had notseemed that the township contained so many that it could afford me anyand i fancied that they were peculiarly of the ancient race that dweltin hollow trees ere white men came
in almost all climes the tortoiseand the frog are among the precursors and heralds of this season andbirds fly with song and glancing plumage and plants spring and bloomand winds blow to correct this slight oscillation of the poles andpreserve the equilibrium of nature
as every season seems best to us in its turn so the coming in ofspring is like the creation of cosmos out of chaos and the realizationof the golden age

”a single gentle rain makes the grass many shades greener

we should beblessed if we lived in the present always and took advantage of everyaccident that befell us like the grass which confesses the influenceof the slightest dew that falls on it and did not spend our time inatoning for the neglect of past opportunities which we call doing ourduty
we loiter in winter while it is already spring
in a pleasantspring morning all men’s sins are forgiven
such a day is a truce tovice
while such a sun holds out to burn the vilest sinner may return
through our own recovered innocence we discern the innocence of ourneighbors
you may have known your neighbor yesterday for a thief adrunkard or a sensualist and merely pitied or despised him anddespaired of the world but the sun shines bright and warm this firstspring morning re-creating the world and you meet him at some serenework and see how his exhausted and debauched veins expand with stilljoy and bless the new day feel the spring influence with the innocenceof infancy and all his faults are forgotten
there is not only anatmosphere of good will about him but even a savor of holiness gropingfor expression blindly and ineffectually perhaps like a new-borninstinct and for a short hour the south hill-side echoes to no vulgarjest

“a return to goodness produced each day in the tranquil and beneficentbreath of the morning causes that in respect to the love of virtue andthe hatred of vice one approaches a little the primitive nature ofman as the sprouts of the forest which has been felled
in like mannerthe evil which one does in the interval of a day prevents the germs ofvirtues which began to spring up again from developing themselves anddestroys them
“after the germs of virtue have thus been prevented many times fromdeveloping themselves then the beneficent breath of evening does notsuffice to preserve them
as soon as the breath of evening does notsuffice longer to preserve them then the nature of man does not differmuch from that of the brute
men seeing the nature of this man likethat of the brute think that he has never possessed the innate facultyof reason
are those the true and natural sentiments of man

”on the 29th of april as i was fishing from the bank of the river nearthe nine-acre-corner bridge standing on the quaking grass and willowroots where the muskrats lurk i heard a singular rattling soundsomewhat like that of the sticks which boys play with their fingerswhen looking up i observed a very slight and graceful hawk like anight-hawk alternately soaring like a ripple and tumbling a rod or twoover and over showing the underside of its wings which gleamed like asatin ribbon in the sun or like the pearly inside of a shell
thissight reminded me of falconry and what nobleness and poetry areassociated with that sport
the merlin it seemed to me it might becalled but i care not for its name
it was the most ethereal flight ihad ever witnessed
it did not simply flutter like a butterfly norsoar like the larger hawks but it sported with proud reliance in thefields of air mounting again and again with its strange chuckle itrepeated its free and beautiful fall turning over and over like akite and then recovering from its lofty tumbling as if it had neverset its foot on _terra firma_
it appeared to have no companion in theuniverse—sporting there alone—and to need none but the morning andthe ether with which it played
it was not lonely but made all theearth lonely beneath it
where was the parent which hatched it itskindred and its father in the heavens
the tenant of the air itseemed related to the earth but by an egg hatched some time in thecrevice of a crag—or was its native nest made in the angle of a cloudwoven of the rainbow’s trimmings and the sunset sky and lined withsome soft midsummer haze caught up from earth
its eyry now some cliffycloud
beside this i got a rare mess of golden and silver and bright cupreousfishes which looked like a string of jewels
ah
i have penetrated tothose meadows on the morning of many a first spring day jumping fromhummock to hummock from willow root to willow root when the wildriver valley and the woods were bathed in so pure and bright a light aswould have waked the dead if they had been slumbering in their gravesas some suppose
there needs no stronger proof of immortality
allthings must live in such a light

our village life would stagnate if it were not for the unexploredforests and meadows which surround it
we need the tonic ofwildness—to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and themeadow-hen lurk and hear the booming of the snipe to smell thewhispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl buildsher nest and the mink crawls with its belly close to the ground
atthe same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things werequire that all things be mysterious and unexplorable that land andsea be infinitely wild unsurveyed and unfathomed by us becauseunfathomable
we can never have enough of nature
we must be refreshedby the sight of inexhaustible vigor vast and titanic features thesea-coast with its wrecks the wilderness with its living and itsdecaying trees the thunder cloud and the rain which lasts three weeksand produces freshets
we need to witness our own limits transgressedand some life pasturing freely where we never wander
we are cheeredwhen we observe the vulture feeding on the carrion which disgusts anddisheartens us and deriving health and strength from the repast
therewas a dead horse in the hollow by the path to my house which compelledme sometimes to go out of my way especially in the night when the airwas heavy but the assurance it gave me of the strong appetite andinviolable health of nature was my compensation for this
i love to seethat nature is so rife with life that myriads can be afforded to besacrificed and suffered to prey on one another that tenderorganizations can be so serenely squashed out of existence likepulp—tadpoles which herons gobble up and tortoises and toads run overin the road and that sometimes it has rained flesh and blood

early in may the oaks hickories maples and other trees justputting out amidst the pine woods around the pond imparted abrightness like sunshine to the landscape especially in cloudy daysas if the sun were breaking through mists and shining faintly on thehill-sides here and there

i learned this at least by my experiment that if one advancesconfidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live thelife which he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected incommon hours
he will put some things behind will pass an invisibleboundary new universal and more liberal laws will begin to establishthemselves around and within him or the old laws be expanded andinterpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense and he will live withthe license of a higher order of beings
in proportion as he simplifieshis life the laws of the universe will appear less complex andsolitude will not be solitude nor poverty poverty nor weaknessweakness

there was an artist in the city of kouroo who was disposed to striveafter perfection
one day it came into his mind to make a staff
havingconsidered that in an imperfect work time is an ingredient but into aperfect work time does not enter he said to himself it shall beperfect in all respects though i should do nothing else in my life
heproceeded instantly to the forest for wood being resolved that itshould not be made of unsuitable material and as he searched for andrejected stick after stick his friends gradually deserted him forthey grew old in their works and died but he grew not older by amoment
his singleness of purpose and resolution and his elevatedpiety endowed him without his knowledge with perennial youth
as hemade no compromise with time time kept out of his way and only sighedat a distance because he could not overcome him
before he had found astock in all respects suitable the city of kouroo was a hoary ruin andhe sat on one of its mounds to peel the stick
before he had given itthe proper shape the dynasty of the candahars was at an end and withthe point of the stick he wrote the name of the last of that race inthe sand and then resumed his work
by the time he had smoothed andpolished the staff kalpa was no longer the pole-star and ere he hadput on the ferrule and the head adorned with precious stones brahmahad awoke and slumbered many times
but why do i stay to mention thesethings
when the finishing stroke was put to his work it suddenlyexpanded before the eyes of the astonished artist into the fairest ofall the creations of brahma
he had made a new system in making astaff a world with full and fair proportions in which though the oldcities and dynasties had passed away fairer and more glorious ones hadtaken their places
and now he saw by the heap of shavings still freshat his feet that for him and his work the former lapse of time hadbeen an illusion and that no more time had elapsed than is requiredfor a single scintillation from the brain of brahma to fall on andinflame the tinder of a mortal brain
the material was pure and hisart was pure how could the result be other than wonderful

the endon the duty of civil disobediencei heartily accept the motto—“that government is best which governsleast” and i should like to see it acted up to more rapidly andsystematically
carried out it finally amounts to this which also ibelieve—“that government is best which governs not at all” and whenmen are prepared for it that will be the kind of government which theywill have
government is at best but an expedient but most governmentsare usually and all governments are sometimes inexpedient
theobjections which have been brought against a standing army and theyare many and weighty and deserve to prevail may also at last bebrought against a standing government
the standing army is only an armof the standing government
the government itself which is only themode which the people have chosen to execute their will is equallyliable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it
witness the present mexican war the work of comparatively a fewindividuals using the standing government as their tool for in theoutset the people would not have consented to this measure
this american government—what is it but a tradition though a recentone endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity but eachinstant losing some of its integrity
it has not the vitality and forceof a single living man for a single man can bend it to his will
it isa sort of wooden gun to the people themselves and if ever they shoulduse it in earnest as a real one against each other it will surelysplit
but it is not the less necessary for this for the people musthave some complicated machinery or other and hear its din to satisfythat idea of government which they have
governments show thus howsuccessfully men can be imposed on even impose on themselves fortheir own advantage
it is excellent we must all allow yet thisgovernment never of itself furthered any enterprise but by thealacrity with which it got out of its way
_it_ does not keep thecountry free
_it_ does not settle the west
_it_ does not educate
thecharacter inherent in the american people has done all that has beenaccomplished and it would have done somewhat more if the governmenthad not sometimes got in its way
for government is an expedient bywhich men would fain succeed in letting one another alone and as hasbeen said when it is most expedient the governed are most let aloneby it
trade and commerce if they were not made of india rubber wouldnever manage to bounce over obstacles which legislators are continuallyputting in their way and if one were to judge these men wholly by theeffects of their actions and not partly by their intentions theywould deserve to be classed and punished with those mischievous personswho put obstructions on the railroads
but to speak practically and as a citizen unlike those who callthemselves no-government men i ask for not at once no government but_at once_ a better government
let every man make known what kind ofgovernment would command his respect and that will be one step towardobtaining it
after all the practical reason why when the power is once in thehands of the people a majority are permitted and for a long periodcontinue to rule is not because they are most likely to be in theright nor because this seems fairest to the minority but because theyare physically the strongest
but a government in which the majorityrule in all cases can not be based on justice even as far as menunderstand it
can there not be a government in which the majorities donot virtually decide right and wrong but conscience
—in whichmajorities decide only those questions to which the rule of expediencyis applicable
must the citizen ever for a moment or in the leastdegree resign his conscience to the legislator
why has every man aconscience then
i think that we should be men first and subjectsafterward
it is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law somuch as for the right
the only obligation which i have a right toassume is to do at any time what i think right
it is truly enoughsaid that a corporation has no conscience but a corporation ofconscientious men is a corporation _with_ a conscience
law never mademen a whit more just and by means of their respect for it even thewell-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice
a common andnatural result of an undue respect for the law is that you may see afile of soldiers colonel captain corporal privates powder-monkeysand all marching in admirable order over hill and dale to the warsagainst their wills aye against their common sense and conscienceswhich makes it very steep marching indeed and produces a palpitationof the heart
they have no doubt that it is a damnable business inwhich they are concerned they are all peaceably inclined
now whatare they

or small movable forts and magazines at theservice of some unscrupulous man in power
visit the navy yard andbehold a marine such a man as an american government can make or suchas it can make a man with its black arts a mere shadow andreminiscence of humanity a man laid out alive and standing andalready as one may say buried under arms with funeral accompanimentthough it may be     “not a drum was heard not a funeral note         as his corpse to the ramparts we hurried     not a soldier discharged his farewell shot         o’er the grave where our hero we buried
”the mass of men serve the state thus not as men mainly but asmachines with their bodies
they are the standing army and themilitia jailers constables _posse comitatus_ &c
in most casesthere is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moralsense but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth andstones and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve thepurpose as well
such command no more respect than men of straw or alump of dirt
they have the same sort of worth only as horses and dogs
yet such as these even are commonly esteemed good citizens
others asmost legislators politicians lawyers ministers and office-holdersserve the state chiefly with their heads and as they rarely make anymoral distinctions they are as likely to serve the devil without_intending_ it as god
a very few as heroes patriots martyrsreformers in the great sense and _men_ serve the state with theirconsciences also and so necessarily resist it for the most part andthey are commonly treated by it as enemies
a wise man will only beuseful as a man and will not submit to be “clay” and “stop a hole tokeep the wind away” but leave that office to his dust at least     “i am too high-born to be propertied     to be a secondary at control     or useful serving-man and instrument     to any sovereign state throughout the world
”he who gives himself entirely to his fellow-men appears to them uselessand selfish but he who gives himself partially to them is pronounced abenefactor and philanthropist
how does it become a man to behave toward the american governmenttoday
i answer that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it
i cannot for an instant recognize that political organization as _my_government which is the _slave’s_ government also
all men recognize the right of revolution that is the right to refuseallegiance to and to resist the government when its tyranny or itsinefficiency are great and unendurable
but almost all say that such isnot the case now
but such was the case they think in the revolutionof ’75
if one were to tell me that this was a bad government becauseit taxed certain foreign commodities brought to its ports it is mostprobable that i should not make an ado about it for i can do withoutthem all machines have their friction and possibly this does enoughgood to counter-balance the evil
at any rate it is a great evil tomake a stir about it
but when the friction comes to have its machineand oppression and robbery are organized i say let us not have such amachine any longer
in other words when a sixth of the population of anation which has undertaken to be the refuge of liberty are slaves anda whole country is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign armyand subjected to military law i think that it is not too soon forhonest men to rebel and revolutionize
what makes this duty the moreurgent is that fact that the country so overrun is not our own butours is the invading army
paley a common authority with many on moral questions in his chapteron the “duty of submission to civil government” resolves all civilobligation into expediency and he proceeds to say “that so long asthe interest of the whole society requires it that is so long as theestablished government cannot be resisted or changed without publicinconveniency it is the will of god that the established government beobeyed and no longer
”—“this principle being admitted the justice ofevery particular case of resistance is reduced to a computation of thequantity of the danger and grievance on the one side and of theprobability and expense of redressing it on the other
” of this hesays every man shall judge for himself
but paley appears never tohave contemplated those cases to which the rule of expediency does notapply in which a people as well as an individual must do justicecost what it may
if i have unjustly wrested a plank from a drowningman i must restore it to him though i drown myself
this according topaley would be inconvenient
but he that would save his life in sucha case shall lose it
this people must cease to hold slaves and tomake war on mexico though it cost them their existence as a people
in their practice nations agree with paley but does anyone think thatmassachusetts does exactly what is right at the present crisis
“a drab of state a cloth-o’-silver slut     to have her train borne up and her soul trail in the dirt
”practically speaking the opponents to a reform in massachusetts arenot a hundred thousand politicians at the south but a hundred thousandmerchants and farmers here who are more interested in commerce andagriculture than they are in humanity and are not prepared to dojustice to the slave and to mexico _cost what it may_
i quarrel notwith far-off foes but with those who near at home co-operate withand do the bidding of those far away and without whom the latter wouldbe harmless
we are accustomed to say that the mass of men areunprepared but improvement is slow because the few are not materiallywiser or better than the many
it is not so important that many shouldbe as good as you as that there be some absolute goodness somewherefor that will leaven the whole lump
there are thousands who are _inopinion_ opposed to slavery and to the war who yet in effect donothing to put an end to them who esteeming themselves children ofwashington and franklin sit down with their hands in their pocketsand say that they know not what to do and do nothing who evenpostpone the question of freedom to the question of free-trade andquietly read the prices-current along with the latest advices frommexico after dinner and it may be fall asleep over them both
whatis the price-current of an honest man and patriot today
they hesitateand they regret and sometimes they petition but they do nothing inearnest and with effect
they will wait well disposed for others toremedy the evil that they may no longer have it to regret
at mostthey give only a cheap vote and a feeble countenance and godspeed tothe right as it goes by them
there are nine hundred and ninety-ninepatrons of virtue to one virtuous man but it is easier to deal withthe real possessor of a thing than with the temporary guardian of it
all voting is a sort of gaming like chequers or backgammon with aslight moral tinge to it a playing with right and wrong with moralquestions and betting naturally accompanies it
the character of thevoters is not staked
i cast my vote perchance as i think right buti am not vitally concerned that that right should prevail
i am willingto leave it to the majority
its obligation therefore never exceedsthat of expediency
even voting _for the right_ is _doing_ nothing forit
it is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it shouldprevail
a wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chancenor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority
there is butlittle virtue in the action of masses of men
when the majority shallat length vote for the abolition of slavery it will be because theyare indifferent to slavery or because there is but little slavery leftto be abolished by their vote
_they_ will then be the only slaves
only _his_ vote can hasten the abolition of slavery who asserts his ownfreedom by his vote
i hear of a convention to be held at baltimore or elsewhere for theselection of a candidate for the presidency made up chiefly ofeditors and men who are politicians by profession but i think whatis it to any independent intelligent and respectable man whatdecision they may come to shall we not have the advantage of hiswisdom and honesty nevertheless
can we not count upon someindependent votes
are there not many individuals in the country who donot attend conventions
but no i find that the respectable man socalled has immediately drifted from his position and despairs of hiscountry when his country has more reasons to despair of him
heforthwith adopts one of the candidates thus selected as the only_available_ one thus proving that he is himself _available_ for anypurposes of the demagogue
his vote is of no more worth than that ofany unprincipled foreigner or hireling native who may have beenbought
oh for a man who is a _man_ and as my neighbor says has abone in his back which you cannot pass your hand through
ourstatistics are at fault the population has been returned too large
how many _men_ are there to a square thousand miles in the country
hardly one
does not america offer any inducement for men to settlehere
the american has dwindled into an odd fellow—one who may beknown by the development of his organ of gregariousness and a manifestlack of intellect and cheerful self-reliance whose first and chiefconcern on coming into the world is to see that the alms-houses arein good repair and before yet he has lawfully donned the virile garbto collect a fund for the support of the widows and orphans that maybe who in short ventures to live only by the aid of the mutualinsurance company which has promised to bury him decently
it is not a man’s duty as a matter of course to devote himself to theeradication of any even the most enormous wrong he may still properlyhave other concerns to engage him but it is his duty at least towash his hands of it and if he gives it no thought longer not togive it practically his support
if i devote myself to other pursuitsand contemplations i must first see at least that i do not pursuethem sitting upon another man’s shoulders
i must get off him firstthat he may pursue his contemplations too
see what gross inconsistencyis tolerated
i have heard some of my townsmen say “i should like tohave them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slavesor to march to mexico—see if i would go” and yet these very men haveeach directly by their allegiance and so indirectly at least bytheir money furnished a substitute
the soldier is applauded whorefuses to serve in an unjust war by those who do not refuse to sustainthe unjust government which makes the war is applauded by those whoseown act and authority he disregards and sets at naught as if the statewere penitent to that degree that it hired one to scourge it while itsinned but not to that degree that it left off sinning for a moment
thus under the name of order and civil government we are all made atlast to pay homage to and support our own meanness
after the firstblush of sin comes its indifference and from immoral it becomes asit were _un_moral and not quite unnecessary to that life which wehave made
the broadest and most prevalent error requires the most disinterestedvirtue to sustain it
the slight reproach to which the virtue ofpatriotism is commonly liable the noble are most likely to incur
those who while they disapprove of the character and measures of agovernment yield to it their allegiance and support are undoubtedlyits most conscientious supporters and so frequently the most seriousobstacles to reform
some are petitioning the state to dissolve theunion to disregard the requisitions of the president
why do they notdissolve it themselves—the union between themselves and the state—andrefuse to pay their quota into its treasury
do not they stand in samerelation to the state that the state does to the union
and have notthe same reasons prevented the state from resisting the union whichhave prevented them from resisting the state
how can a man be satisfied to entertain an opinion merely and enjoy_it
_ is there any enjoyment in it if his opinion is that he isaggrieved
if you are cheated out of a single dollar by your neighboryou do not rest satisfied with knowing you are cheated or with sayingthat you are cheated or even with petitioning him to pay you your duebut you take effectual steps at once to obtain the full amount and seethat you are never cheated again
action from principle—the perceptionand the performance of right—changes things and relations it isessentially revolutionary and does not consist wholly with anythingwhich was

unjust laws exist shall we be content to obey them or shall weendeavor to amend them and obey them until we have succeeded or shallwe transgress them at once
men generally under such a government asthis think that they ought to wait until they have persuaded themajority to alter them
they think that if they should resist theremedy would be worse than the evil
but it is the fault of thegovernment itself that the remedy _is_ worse than the evil
_it_ makesit worse
why is it not more apt to anticipate and provide for reform
why does it not cherish its wise minority
why does it cry and resistbefore it is hurt
why does it not encourage its citizens to be on thealert to point out its faults and _do_ better than it would have them
why does it always crucify christ and excommunicate copernicus andluther and pronounce washington and franklin rebels
one would think that a deliberate and practical denial of itsauthority was the only offence never contemplated by government elsewhy has it not assigned its definite its suitable and proportionatepenalty
if a man who has no property refuses but once to earn nineshillings for the state he is put in prison for a period unlimited byany law that i know and determined only by the discretion of those whoplaced him there but if he should steal ninety times nine shillingsfrom the state he is soon permitted to go at large again
if the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine ofgovernment let it go let it go perchance it will wearsmooth—certainly the machine will wear out
if the injustice has aspring or a pulley or a rope or a crank exclusively for itselfthen perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse thanthe evil but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be theagent of injustice to another then i say break the law
let yourlife be a counter friction to stop the machine
what i have to do is tosee at any rate that i do not lend myself to the wrong which icondemn
as for adopting the ways which the state has provided for remedying theevil i know not of such ways
they take too much time and a man’slife will be gone
i have other affairs to attend to
i came into thisworld not chiefly to make this a good place to live in but to live init be it good or bad
a man has not every thing to do but somethingand because he cannot do _every thing_ it is not necessary that heshould do _something_ wrong
it is not my business to be petitioningthe governor or the legislature any more than it is theirs to petitionme and if they should not hear my petition what should i do then
but in this case the state has provided no way its very constitutionis the evil
this may seem to be harsh and stubborn andunconcilliatory but it is to treat with the utmost kindness andconsideration the only spirit that can appreciate or deserves it
so isall change for the better like birth and death which convulse thebody
i do not hesitate to say that those who call themselves abolitionistsshould at once effectually withdraw their support both in person andproperty from the government of massachusetts and not wait till theyconstitute a majority of one before they suffer the right to prevailthrough them
i think that it is enough if they have god on their sidewithout waiting for that other one
moreover any man more right thanhis neighbors constitutes a majority of one already
i meet this american government or its representative the stategovernment directly and face to face once a year no more in theperson of its tax-gatherer this is the only mode in which a mansituated as i am necessarily meets it and it then says distinctlyrecognize me and the simplest the most effectual and in the presentposture of affairs the indispensablest mode of treating with it onthis head of expressing your little satisfaction with and love for itis to deny it then
my civil neighbor the tax-gatherer is the veryman i have to deal with—for it is after all with men and not withparchment that i quarrel—and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agentof the government
how shall he ever know well what he is and does asan officer of the government or as a man until he is obliged toconsider whether he shall treat me his neighbor for whom he hasrespect as a neighbor and well-disposed man or as a maniac anddisturber of the peace and see if he can get over this obstruction tohis neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speechcorresponding with his action
i know this well that if one thousandif one hundred if ten men whom i could name—if ten _honest_ menonly—aye if _one_ honest man in this state of massachusetts_ceasing to hold slaves_ were actually to withdraw from thiscopartnership and be locked up in the county jail therefor it wouldbe the abolition of slavery in america
for it matters not how smallthe beginning may seem to be what is once well done is done for ever
but we love better to talk about it that we say is our mission
reformkeeps many scores of newspapers in its service but not one man
if myesteemed neighbor the state’s ambassador who will devote his days tothe settlement of the question of human rights in the council chamberinstead of being threatened with the prisons of carolina were to sitdown the prisoner of massachusetts that state which is so anxious tofoist the sin of slavery upon her sister—though at present she candiscover only an act of inhospitality to be the ground of a quarrelwith her—the legislature would not wholly waive the subject of thefollowing winter
under a government which imprisons any unjustly the true place for ajust man is also a prison
the proper place today the only place whichmassachusetts has provided for her freer and less desponding spiritsis in her prisons to be put out and locked out of the state by her ownact as they have already put themselves out by their principles
it isthere that the fugitive slave and the mexican prisoner on parole andthe indian come to plead the wrongs of his race should find them onthat separate but more free and honorable ground where the stateplaces those who are not _with_ her but _against_ her—the only housein a slave-state in which a free man can abide with honor
if any thinkthat their influence would be lost there and their voices no longerafflict the ear of the state that they would not be as an enemy withinits walls they do not know by how much truth is stronger than errornor how much more eloquently and effectively he can combat injusticewho has experienced a little in his own person
cast your whole votenot a strip of paper merely but your whole influence
a minority ispowerless while it conforms to the majority it is not even a minoritythen but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight
if thealternative is to keep all just men in prison or give up war andslavery the state will not hesitate which to choose
if a thousand menwere not to pay their tax-bills this year that would not be a violentand bloody measure as it would be to pay them and enable the state tocommit violence and shed innocent blood
this is in fact thedefinition of a peaceable revolution if any such is possible
if thetax-gatherer or any other public officer asks me as one has done“but what shall i do
” my answer is “if you really wish to do anything resign your office
” when the subject has refused allegianceand the officer has resigned his office then the revolution isaccomplished
but even suppose blood should flow
is there not a sortof blood shed when the conscience is wounded
through this wound aman’s real manhood and immortality flow out and he bleeds to aneverlasting death
i see this blood flowing now
i have contemplated the imprisonment of the offender rather than theseizure of his goods—though both will serve the same purpose—becausethey who assert the purest right and consequently are most dangerousto a corrupt state commonly have not spent much time in accumulatingproperty
to such the state renders comparatively small service and aslight tax is wont to appear exorbitant particularly if they areobliged to earn it by special labor with their hands
if there were onewho lived wholly without the use of money the state itself wouldhesitate to demand it of him
but the rich man—not to make anyinvidious comparison—is always sold to the institution which makes himrich
absolutely speaking the more money the less virtue for moneycomes between a man and his objects and obtains them for him it wascertainly no great virtue to obtain it
it puts to rest many questionswhich he would otherwise be taxed to answer while the only newquestion which it puts is the hard but superfluous one how to spendit
thus his moral ground is taken from under his feet
theopportunities of living are diminished in proportion as what are calledthe “means” are increased
the best thing a man can do for his culturewhen he is rich is to endeavor to carry out those schemes which heentertained when he was poor
christ answered the herodians accordingto their condition
“show me the tribute-money” said he—and one tooka penny out of his pocket—if you use money which has the image ofcæsar on it and which he has made current and valuable that is _ifyou are men of the state_ and gladly enjoy the advantages of cæsar’sgovernment then pay him back some of his own when he demands it“render therefore to cæsar that which is cæsar’s and to god thosethings which are god’s”—leaving them no wiser than before as to whichwas which for they did not wish to know
when i converse with the freest of my neighbors i perceive thatwhatever they may say about the magnitude and seriousness of thequestion and their regard for the public tranquillity the long andthe short of the matter is that they cannot spare the protection ofthe existing government and they dread the consequences ofdisobedience to it to their property and families
for my own part ishould not like to think that i ever rely on the protection of thestate
but if i deny the authority of the state when it presents itstax-bill it will soon take and waste all my property and so harass meand my children without end
this is hard
this makes it impossible fora man to live honestly and at the same time comfortably in outwardrespects
it will not be worth the while to accumulate property thatwould be sure to go again
you must hire or squat somewhere and raisebut a small crop and eat that soon
you must live within yourself anddepend upon yourself always tucked up and ready for a start and nothave many affairs
a man may grow rich in turkey even if he will be inall respects a good subject of the turkish government
confuciussaid—“if a state is governed by the principles of reason poverty andmisery are subjects of shame if a state is not governed by theprinciples of reason riches and honors are the subjects of shame
” nountil i want the protection of massachusetts to be extended to me insome distant southern port where my liberty is endangered or until iam bent solely on building up an estate at home by peaceful enterprisei can afford to refuse allegiance to massachusetts and her right to myproperty and life
it costs me less in every sense to incur the penaltyof disobedience to the state than it would to obey
i should feel asif i were worth less in that case
some years ago the state met me in behalf of the church and commandedme to pay a certain sum toward the support of a clergyman whosepreaching my father attended but never i myself
“pay it” it said“or be locked up in the jail
” i declined to pay
but unfortunatelyanother man saw fit to pay it
i did not see why the schoolmastershould be taxed to support the priest and not the priest theschoolmaster for i was not the state’s schoolmaster but i supportedmyself by voluntary subscription
i did not see why the lyceum shouldnot present its tax-bill and have the state to back its demand aswell as the church
however at the request of the selectmen icondescended to make some such statement as this in writing—“know allmen by these presents that i henry thoreau do not wish to beregarded as a member of any incorporated society which i have notjoined
” this i gave to the town-clerk and he has it
the statehaving thus learned that i did not wish to be regarded as a member ofthat church has never made a like demand on me since though it saidthat it must adhere to its original presumption that time
if i hadknown how to name them i should then have signed off in detail fromall the societies which i never signed on to but i did not know whereto find such a complete list
i have paid no poll-tax for six years
i was put into a jail once onthis account for one night and as i stood considering the walls ofsolid stone two or three feet thick the door of wood and iron a footthick and the iron grating which strained the light i could not helpbeing struck with the foolishness of that institution which treated meas if i were mere flesh and blood and bones to be locked up
iwondered that it should have concluded at length that this was the bestuse it could put me to and had never thought to avail itself of myservices in some way
i saw that if there was a wall of stone betweenme and my townsmen there was a still more difficult one to climb orbreak through before they could get to be as free as i was
i did norfor a moment feel confined and the walls seemed a great waste of stoneand mortar
i felt as if i alone of all my townsmen had paid my tax
they plainly did not know how to treat me but behaved like persons whoare underbred
in every threat and in every compliment there was ablunder for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the otherside of that stone wall
i could not but smile to see how industriouslythey locked the door on my meditations which followed them out againwithout let or hindrance and _they_ were really all that wasdangerous
as they could not reach me they had resolved to punish mybody just as boys if they cannot come at some person against whomthey have a spite will abuse his dog
i saw that the state washalf-witted that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoonsand that it did not know its friends from its foes and i lost all myremaining respect for it and pitied it
thus the state never intentionally confronts a man’s senseintellectual or moral but only his body his senses
it is not armedwith superior wit or honesty but with superior physical strength
iwas not born to be forced
i will breathe after my own fashion
let ussee who is the strongest
what force has a multitude
they only canforce me who obey a higher law than i
they force me to become likethemselves
i do not hear of _men_ being _forced_ to live this way orthat by masses of men
what sort of life were that to live
when i meeta government which says to me “your money or your life” why should ibe in haste to give it my money
it may be in a great strait and notknow what to do i cannot help that
it must help itself do as i do
it is not worth the while to snivel about it
i am not responsible forthe successful working of the machinery of society
i am not the son ofthe engineer
i perceive that when an acorn and a chestnut fall sideby side the one does not remain inert to make way for the other butboth obey their own laws and spring and grow and flourish as best theycan till one perchance overshadows and destroys the other
if aplant cannot live according to its nature it dies and so a man
the night in prison was novel and interesting enough
the prisoners intheir shirt-sleeves were enjoying a chat and the evening air in thedoor-way when i entered
but the jailer said “come boys it is timeto lock up” and so they dispersed and i heard the sound of theirsteps returning into the hollow apartments
my room-mate was introducedto me by the jailer as “a first-rate fellow and a clever man
” when thedoor was locked he showed me where to hang my hat and how he managedmatters there
the rooms were whitewashed once a month and this oneat least was the whitest most simply furnished and probably theneatest apartment in town
he naturally wanted to know where i camefrom and what brought me there and when i had told him i asked himin my turn how he came there presuming him to be an honest man ofcourse and as the world goes i believe he was
“why” said he “theyaccuse me of burning a barn but i never did it
” as near as i coulddiscover he had probably gone to bed in a barn when drunk and smokedhis pipe there and so a barn was burnt
he had the reputation of beinga clever man had been there some three months waiting for his trial tocome on and would have to wait as much longer but he was quitedomesticated and contented since he got his board for nothing andthought that he was well treated
he occupied one window and i the other and i saw that if one stayedthere long his principal business would be to look out the window
ihad soon read all the tracts that were left there and examined whereformer prisoners had broken out and where a grate had been sawed offand heard the history of the various occupants of that room for ifound that even here there was a history and a gossip which nevercirculated beyond the walls of the jail
probably this is the onlyhouse in the town where verses are composed which are afterwardprinted in a circular form but not published
i was shown quite a longlist of verses which were composed by some young men who had beendetected in an attempt to escape who avenged themselves by singingthem
i pumped my fellow-prisoner as dry as i could for fear i should neversee him again but at length he showed me which was my bed and left meto blow out the lamp
it was like travelling into a far country such as i had never expectedto behold to lie there for one night
it seemed to me that i never hadheard the town-clock strike before nor the evening sounds of thevillage for we slept with the windows open which were inside thegrating
it was to see my native village in the light of the middleages and our concord was turned into a rhine stream and visions ofknights and castles passed before me
they were the voices of oldburghers that i heard in the streets
i was an involuntary spectatorand auditor of whatever was done and said in the kitchen of theadjacent village-inn—a wholly new and rare experience to me
it was acloser view of my native town
i was fairly inside of it
i never hadseen its institutions before
this is one of its peculiar institutionsfor it is a shire town
i began to comprehend what its inhabitants wereabout
in the morning our breakfasts were put through the hole in the doorin small oblong-square tin pans made to fit and holding a pint ofchocolate with brown bread and an iron spoon
when they called forthe vessels again i was green enough to return what bread i had leftbut my comrade seized it and said that i should lay that up for lunchor dinner
soon after he was let out to work at haying in aneighboring field whither he went every day and would not be backtill noon so he bade me good-day saying that he doubted if he shouldsee me again
when i came out of prison—for some one interfered and paid the tax—idid not perceive that great changes had taken place on the common suchas he observed who went in a youth and emerged a gray-headed man andyet a change had to my eyes come over the scene—the town and stateand country—greater than any that mere time could effect
i saw yetmore distinctly the state in which i lived
i saw to what extent thepeople among whom i lived could be trusted as good neighbors andfriends that their friendship was for summer weather only that theydid not greatly purpose to do right that they were a distinct racefrom me by their prejudices and superstitions as the chinamen andmalays are that in their sacrifices to humanity they ran no risksnot even to their property that after all they were not so noble butthey treated the thief as he had treated them and hoped by a certainoutward observance and a few prayers and by walking in a particularstraight though useless path from time to time to save their souls
this may be to judge my neighbors harshly for i believe that most ofthem are not aware that they have such an institution as the jail intheir village
it was formerly the custom in our village when a poor debtor came outof jail for his acquaintances to salute him looking through theirfingers which were crossed to represent the grating of a jail window“how do ye do
” my neighbors did not thus salute me but first lookedat me and then at one another as if i had returned from a longjourney
i was put into jail as i was going to the shoemaker’s to get ashoe which was mended
when i was let out the next morning i proceededto finish my errand and having put on my mended shoe joined ahuckleberry party who were impatient to put themselves under myconduct and in half an hour—for the horse was soon tackled—was inthe midst of a huckleberry field on one of our highest hills twomiles off and then the state was nowhere to be seen
this is the whole history of “my prisons
”i have never declined paying the highway tax because i am as desirousof being a good neighbor as i am of being a bad subject and as forsupporting schools i am doing my part to educate my fellow-countrymennow
it is for no particular item in the tax-bill that i refuse to payit
i simply wish to refuse allegiance to the state to withdraw andstand aloof from it effectually
i do not care to trace the course ofmy dollar if i could till it buys a man or a musket to shoot onewith—the dollar is innocent—but i am concerned to trace the effectsof my allegiance
in fact i quietly declare war with the state aftermy fashion though i will still make use and get what advantages of heri can as is usual in such cases
if others pay the tax which is demanded of me from a sympathy with thestate they do but what they have already done in their own case orrather they abet injustice to a greater extent than the state requires
if they pay the tax from a mistaken interest in the individual taxedto save his property or prevent his going to jail it is because theyhave not considered wisely how far they let their private feelingsinterfere with the public good
this then is my position at present
but one cannot be too much onhis guard in such a case lest his actions be biassed by obstinacy oran undue regard for the opinions of men
let him see that he does onlywhat belongs to himself and to the hour
i think sometimes why this people mean well they are only ignorantthey would do better if they knew how why give your neighbors thispain to treat you as they are not inclined to
but i think again thisis no reason why i should do as they do or permit others to suffermuch greater pain of a different kind
again i sometimes say tomyself when many millions of men without heat without ill-willwithout personal feeling of any kind demand of you a few shillingsonly without the possibility such is their constitution ofretracting or altering their present demand and without thepossibility on your side of appeal to any other millions why exposeyourself to this overwhelming brute force
you do not resist cold andhunger the winds and the waves thus obstinately you quietly submitto a thousand similar necessities
you do not put your head into thefire
but just in proportion as i regard this as not wholly a bruteforce but partly a human force and consider that i have relations tothose millions as to so many millions of men and not of mere brute orinanimate things i see that appeal is possible first andinstantaneously from them to the maker of them and secondly fromthem to themselves
but if i put my head deliberately into the firethere is no appeal to fire or to the maker of fire and i have onlymyself to blame
if i could convince myself that i have any right to besatisfied with men as they are and to treat them accordingly and notaccording in some respects to my requisitions and expectations ofwhat they and i ought to be then like a good mussulman and fatalisti should endeavor to be satisfied with things as they are and say itis the will of god
and above all there is this difference betweenresisting this and a purely brute or natural force that i can resistthis with some effect but i cannot expect like orpheus to change thenature of the rocks and trees and beasts
i do not wish to quarrel with any man or nation
i do not wish to splithairs to make fine distinctions or set myself up as better than myneighbors
i seek rather i may say even an excuse for conforming tothe laws of the land
i am but too ready to conform to them
indeed ihave reason to suspect myself on this head and each year as thetax-gatherer comes round i find myself disposed to review the acts andposition of the general and state governments and the spirit of thepeople to discover a pretext for conformity
“we must affect our country as our parents     and if at any time we alienate     out love of industry from doing it honor     we must respect effects and teach the soul     matter of conscience and religion     and not desire of rule or benefit
”i believe that the state will soon be able to take all my work of thissort out of my hands and then i shall be no better patriot than myfellow-countrymen
seen from a lower point of view the constitutionwith all its faults is very good the law and the courts are veryrespectable even this state and this american government are in manyrespects very admirable and rare things to be thankful for such asa great many have described them seen from a higher still and thehighest who shall say what they are or that they are worth looking ator thinking of at all
however the government does not concern me much and i shall bestowthe fewest possible thoughts on it
it is not many moments that i liveunder a government even in this world
if a man is thought-freefancy-free imagination-free that which _is not_ never for a long timeappearing _to be_ to him unwise rulers or reformers cannot fatallyinterrupt him
i know that most men think differently from myself but those whoselives are by profession devoted to the study of these or kindredsubjects content me as little as any
statesmen and legislatorsstanding so completely within the institution never distinctly andnakedly behold it
they speak of moving society but have noresting-place without it
they may be men of a certain experience anddiscrimination and have no doubt invented ingenious and even usefulsystems for which we sincerely thank them but all their wit andusefulness lie within certain not very wide limits
they are wont toforget that the world is not governed by policy and expediency
websternever goes behind government and so cannot speak with authority aboutit
his words are wisdom to those legislators who contemplate noessential reform in the existing government but for thinkers andthose who legislate for all time he never once glances at the subject
i know of those whose serene and wise speculations on this theme wouldsoon reveal the limits of his mind’s range and hospitality
yetcompared with the cheap professions of most reformers and the stillcheaper wisdom and eloquence of politicians in general his are almostthe only sensible and valuable words and we thank heaven for him
comparatively he is always strong original and above allpractical
still his quality is not wisdom but prudence
the lawyer’struth is not truth but consistency or a consistent expediency
truthis always in harmony with herself and is not concerned chiefly toreveal the justice that may consist with wrong-doing
he well deservesto be called as he has been called the defender of the constitution
there are really no blows to be given by him but defensive ones
he isnot a leader but a follower
his leaders are the men of ’87
“i havenever made an effort” he says “and never propose to make an effort ihave never countenanced an effort and never mean to countenance aneffort to disturb the arrangement as originally made by which thevarious states came into the union
” still thinking of the sanctionwhich the constitution gives to slavery he says “because it was partof the original compact—let it stand
” notwithstanding his specialacuteness and ability he is unable to take a fact out of its merelypolitical relations and behold it as it lies absolutely to be disposedof by the intellect—what for instance it behoves a man to do here inamerica today with regard to slavery but ventures or is driven tomake some such desperate answer as the following while professing tospeak absolutely and as a private man—from which what new andsingular code of social duties might be inferred
—“the manner” sayshe “in which the governments of those states where slavery exists areto regulate it is for their own consideration under theresponsibility to their constituents to the general laws of proprietyhumanity and justice and to god
associations formed elsewherespringing from a feeling of humanity or any other cause have nothingwhatever to do with it
they have never received any encouragement fromme and they never will
”they who know of no purer sources of truth who have traced up itsstream no higher stand and wisely stand by the bible and theconstitution and drink at it there with reverence and humanity butthey who behold where it comes trickling into this lake or that poolgird up their loins once more and continue their pilgrimage toward itsfountain-head
no man with a genius for legislation has appeared in america
they arerare in the history of the world
there are orators politicians andeloquent men by the thousand but the speaker has not yet opened hismouth to speak who is capable of settling the much-vexed questions ofthe day
we love eloquence for its own sake and not for any truthwhich it may utter or any heroism it may inspire
our legislators havenot yet learned the comparative value of free-trade and of freedom ofunion and of rectitude to a nation
they have no genius or talent forcomparatively humble questions of taxation and finance commerce andmanufactures and agriculture
if we were left solely to the wordy witof legislators in congress for our guidance uncorrected by theseasonable experience and the effectual complaints of the peopleamerica would not long retain her rank among the nations
for eighteenhundred years though perchance i have no right to say it the newtestament has been written yet where is the legislator who has wisdomand practical talent enough to avail himself of the light which itsheds on the science of legislation
the authority of government even such as i am willing to submitto—for i will cheerfully obey those who know and can do better than iand in many things even those who neither know nor can do so well—isstill an impure one to be strictly just it must have the sanction andconsent of the governed
it can have no pure right over my person andproperty but what i concede to it
the progress from an absolute to alimited monarchy from a limited monarchy to a democracy is a progresstoward a true respect for the individual
even the chinese philosopherwas wise enough to regard the individual as the basis of the empire
isa democracy such as we know it the last improvement possible ingovernment
is it not possible to take a step further towardsrecognizing and organizing the rights of man
there will never be areally free and enlightened state until the state comes to recognizethe individual as a higher and independent power from which all itsown power and authority are derived and treats him accordingly
iplease myself with imagining a state at last which can afford to bejust to all men and to treat the individual with respect as aneighbor which even would not think it inconsistent with its ownrepose if a few were to live aloof from it not meddling with it norembraced by it who fulfilled all the duties of neighbors andfellow-men
a state which bore this kind of fruit and suffered it todrop off as fast as it ripened would prepare the way for a still moreperfect and glorious state which also i have imagined but not yetanywhere seen
